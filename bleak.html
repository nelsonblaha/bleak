<p><b>The following is a 'fork' of a friend's novel:</p></b>

</i>bleakly<i>

The dark little hole I called both work and home was encrusted with the flotsam and jetsam of things I didn’t want to think about: overdue bills, angrily-worded notices, empty bottles. To top it all off, it smelled like stale mildew. Luckily, it smelled enough like cigarettes that the mildew was only barely discernable.

There’s no place like home.

It was a particularly noisy afternoon, and, as I often did, I’d fully opened the broken, rusty window to let the sounds and smells of the city waft in, the better to overpower the buzzing in my head.

So I barely registered the footsteps approaching my door, but as I did I reached into my coat and touched two fingers to my sixty-shooter, just in case. Case-- 

Someone entering my office might mean somebody with a case. Consequently, I almost regretted the desolate state of my office desolate self; I could really use the work, I thought. Alcohol, after all, does not buy itself.

I tried, at the least, to pretend to be somewhat sober and composed. Regardless, I almost choked when the door opened.

It was a fucking robot.

And goddamn was it the hottest robot I’ve seen in my blighted life.

She lit up the room with a synthetic glow under her realer-than-realistic skin; her eyes shimmered darkly-- just a suggestion of crimson afterglow deep within-- as she tossed blonde platinum “hair” across shoulders embraced by a woefully opaque “skin”-tight dress. The air crackled around her, microscopic static discharges making everything in the room stand on end. When she spoke it was like hearing a comfortably aged vinyl record of every woman you ever wanted speak at once; this fact distracted me so much I had to ask her to repeat herself.

 “I said I’ve got a job for you,” she repeated with anything-but-mechanical inflection, those synthetically luscious lips just tantalizingly out of sync with the voice that issued thence.

I lit a cigarette, partly to give me time to rummage around inside myself and see where I’d left my game face. A few seconds later, I discovered it behind the self-loathing and under some exhaustion. No time for those now, I thought. “All right, Miss…”

“Smith.”

“Miss Smith. You have,” I said, offering and replacing a tacitly declined cigarette, “my undivided attention.”

I steeled myself for the next part. I’d already figured she was just a messenger. Either the next part was going to be very uncomfortable and very deadly, or else I’d be lucky and it’d just be deadly.

Her eyes rolled back and staticky modem-sounds gargled in the back of her throat- that was the part I expected. What I wasn’t expecting was the bit that came next.

I’d fully expected a kill-signal to come across her remote relay. That was why, under the table, I already had my own handheld relay prepared to cut the signal and leave her incapacitated.

However, I wasn’t expecting her to start crying. Gritty detectives have been doing this stuff ever since it started being romantic to wear a fedora and solve crime, but in all that time, I don’t think any of us ever figured out how to deal with a weepin’ dame. Even an artificial one. Especially an artificial one. What was I supposed to say?

So I gave her a handkerchief and asked her to tell me her story.

I fumbled around in my desk, working through the clutter to find my pen and well-worn notebook.

“Take it from the top, toots,” I said, riffling past the used pages and readying my pen.

Her gaze was firm, if tear-reddened. “It started two months ago,” she began, pausing to use the handkerchief in a decidedly ladylike (though subtly mechanical) manner. “My father has been coming home from work later and later; he’s been engrossed in his latest project. That’s not unusual. But he’d never speak a word about it, except muttering equations and calculations under his breath when something came to him or he struggled to remember something. And now- now he’s gone missing. He didn’t come home at all two nights ago.”

I noted that she considered someone her father- no doubt an elderly, tinkery sort whose domestic android had simply blown a fuse. I’d just get his number and inform him that his defective ladybot had sought out a detective.

“All right, sweetheart, could you gimme his and your commcode so I can get started while we’re chatting?” I stubbed out my cigarette and tapped the codes into my handheld as she reeled them off. For whatever reason, just as I saved the commcodes, I felt compelled to ask-

“And where’d you say your old man works?”

I copied down the company commcodes as well. Something tickled in the back of my head, something familiar about her story- so I asked her something calculated to keep her talking for a few minutes while I checked out the company’s datanet on my handheld. In moments I’d pulled up the company’s info-

| //OFFiCIAL DATaNET-
| NOCTeR PHArMACEUTICALS AnD CRYoGENICS
| >commcodes
| >business hours
| >locations
| >company manifesto
| >legal information

I got the scoop with a quickness. From the sound of it, Mr. Smith was no chump player. He was one of their top guys, working on stuff ranging from cancer cures to extrasensory perception.

Beautiful robodames, genius scientists, and drugs. I was interested. I was very interested.

I was satisfied this bionic temptress wasn’t some defective housebot or a cheap trap. Either this was the real deal, or a very expensive trap- and I hate to let somebody spend money on me and have it go to waste.

I needed some time to get in touch with the relevant people.

“We can talk payment after I make a few calls,” I said. If I was right, her old man would be valuable enough on his own to pay my retainer- and if there was a real case here, involving Nocter Rx’s very own confidential information, I could be set for life.

After closing my door on her, I realized I hadn’t eaten anything but whiskey in two days. I opened the door again.

“You can buy me lunch, though. Sharkness cafe, two o’clock.”

“Sure,” she said through those synthetically perfect vocal chords, “I’ll see you there.” Her face was unreadable. Robot emotions can be hard to interpret.

“You’re a sweetheart. I’ll see you then.”

As soon as the door closed, I looked back down at the datascreen and gasped.
My finder processes yielded more information than I could possibly have hoped. Nocter wasn’t just hot on the biotech market, it was hyperluminal, and the only people doing better than the stockholders were the employees. Nocter’s biotechnicians were artisans- they were the best and got paid in kind.

I located Old Man Smith in the datanet registry easily enough. He was a big deal- featured prominently in the periodicals prominent in biotech circles. Wrote a monthly column.

Not last month, though. Which meant he had to have been preoccupied enough to excuse himself. He had to have been working on something big- and with these guys, ‘big’ means ‘damn big.’ I froze the datascreen and went for the door.

Time to do the footwork.

In all honesty I wasn’t sure what to expect when I walked into his office. I’d heard everything about him- that he was insane. That he talked to himself. That he suffered delusions of grandeur and persecution.

That he was the fucking best.

So I opened the door (marked in bold “Thomas Bleakly, PI”) and the smell hit me. Stopped me dead in my tracks, eyes watering. It smelled like someone had poured four cans of Lysol behind a filing cabinet and installed air fresheners in every outlet in the room.

The office was austere and well-lit. His desk was empty, save for a handful of notecards and a cell phone. The walls were bare and it seemed like the carpet sucked the sound out of the air. And for all that, the room was full to the brim, because he was at the center of it.

If his room was monochrome, he was Technicolor. He was slouched over his desk, sucking on an unlit cigarette and drumming his fingers. He wore a faded t-shirt (the design was some comic-book hero) under a brown jacket… and he was wearing a hat. Men haven’t worn hats in almost seventy years, and there he is, looking like he stole that thing from Indiana Jones or Sam Spade. I noticed all of that minutes after I noticed his eyes, though. These blue eyes, I had the feeling was he was looking through me, not at me- hell, who knows what or who he saw.

“I need help,” I managed before I realized that opening my mouth had been a mistake. Everything I’d eat that day would taste of Lysol. His eyes focused on me all of a sudden and I felt a warm chill hit every nerve in me, and suddenly the chemical tang he’d infused his room with for whatever damnable reason was the least of my worries. I could tell just looking at him that he wasn’t just searching my appearance- he was searching my memories, evaluating my emotions. And, for the first time in a month, I felt- strangely enough- safe.

“Sorry, what’d you say?” he folded his hands in front of his face- he wasn’t drumming his fingers anymore but he seemed incapable of ever staying completely still. “I was- I was lost in thought and you look like you think you’re in danger ma’am.”

He was the weird-- why the hell was he talking like that?-- but he was right. I started putting the story together in my head… and everything that’d happened hit me all at once. My cool was gone. My cover was blown. There and then was my last and only chance to be free and dammit I started crying.

I stopped crying a few seconds later, as he’d leapt over his desk and pushed tissues into my hands. His kinetic urgency and his precognition unsettled me enough to leave me stunned and tearless.

With a fantastically inappropriate grin he chucked my chin, winked, and said “Well, darlin’, what’s your story?”

So I told him.

Everything. My father, his disappearance. And he wanted to know it all, plus a lot of really confusing things.

I sat awkwardly as he paced around the little room, scribbling on notecards and promptly discarding them.

He asked for what seemed like random minutia- phone numbers, hat sizes, favorite types of music. I was beginning to wonder- then all at once, he sat, scooped up his cell phone, and locked me in his gaze.

“Now tell me, with as much detail as you can, exactly how your father behaved and what he spoke about when last you saw him. The most microscopic detail may be of the utmost importance.”

I began to recount the last night I’d seen him, my hopes buoyed slightly- finally, a detective-type question! He broke eye contact and began typing rhythmically on his phone… even after I’d stopped talking.

We sat a few moments in silence. I fumbled with a crumpled tissue; he drummed his fingers and mumbled inaudibly to himself.

He looked at me again and asked, “Did your father enjoy golf?”

Back to the weird questions. “Uh… yes. How did you know?”

“He’d listen to Elvis and occasionally the Beatles. He owned lots of vinyl?”

“Yeah, he--”

“He was good with computers but said using pen and paper helped him think,” Bleakly continued. “He was prone to random flashes of insight and would sometimes break off in the middle of a sentence and scribble some new idea or connection on a napkin or whatever scrap was handy.”

I opened my mouth but no sounds came out. 

The guy took off his hat and juggled it back and forth, keeping me locked in his gaze.

“He dabbled in guitar but never learned how to play well. He was a man of many interests but a few great passions, and would often use his hobbies to better connect with his family, always taking any opportunity to show you something new or take you someplace special.”

“Seriously. How do you know this?”

“You were afraid he’d miss your piano recital when you were thirteen but he showed up just in time and took you our for ice cream afterward.”

“How do you know that?”

He nodded slightly and wrote something down on another notecard. “I found his blog. Now, listen, I need some time to do some footwork, so I’ll meet you for lunch at Sharkney’s at two. We’ll discuss payment over lunch- and I’m kind of broke at the moment so I’d appreciate it if you’d be so kind, uh-”

“Alright, sure, whatever. Do you think you can find my father?”

“I would say probably so yes. I’ll talk to you at Sharkney’s. Now leave, I must brood and walk the streets alone.” He shooed me out of the office and closed the door behind me.

“Tom Bleakly, Private Eye,” I muttered. I didn’t know whether the man was a ridiculous savior or a deranged charlatan… but he was the only hope I had of ever seeing my father again. I blew my nose and prayed Bleakly knew what the hell he was doing.

Walking this city’s littered streets under its brown-gray sky is, like I said, my favorite part of a case. Now, I’m not saying it wasn’t miserable or dangerous. It’s just that this was the part where the bad guys were the thugs holding the guns. The simple part. Everything nice and clear-cut, no moral ambiguity– I didn’t have to feel bad about the things I was gonna do… especially because I was gonna do it in self-defense. And in this part of town, I know it’s gonna be self-defense. Starting to get cheerful there, Bleakly. Gotta watch out, think about the really depressing stuff. Gotta concentrate on that slug in your shoulder. Gotta concentrate on the way the cold cuts through that trenchcoat…

 

I hit the bad part of town- hit it pretty hard. I stopped at a few of the worst bars and left hastily from more than one. But that was okay- it was important that I stayed miserable; it kept me clear-headed, and kept the innocents (if there were any) around me safe.

I’m not bragging when I say I had a reputation- not necessarily a big reputation, and not what I would call a lot of respect, you understand, but when people saw me around, they figured I was out to catch somebody doing something they weren’t supposed to be doing. I wasn’t trying to encourage that assumption directly, you see. But I wasn’t going to discourage it either.

It was a beautiful thing. All I had to do was walk around and wait for the guiltiest conscience to pop up. Whoever had it in worst for me that day probably had a reason, so all I had to do was hope I made it through the day ali-

Hey, check it out. Stars. Last time I saw stars, I’d been drugged. Time before that, I got Tased. The time I got drugged didn’t particularly hurt… guess I just got Tased.

There we go. Good old buddy pain seepin’ darkly up the left side of my back- shoulda been watching more closely. That’s what happens when you get cheerful, Bleakly.

I made a quick inventory of my senses and found that while they weren’t at a hundred percent, I had enough to tell me I was being dragged into an alleyway in which was- aha. Oh yes. Your standard, clichè black van. I can’t be sure, but at that point I probably grinned.

In a few minutes, my faculties started coming back online, and I could tell I was bound, blindfolded, and moving somewhere in a vehicle; they left my nose unplugged, apparently- I could smell the tang of cheap, poorly-maintained android. Not much to go on, but if I needed a lot to go on, I’d be in politics. Or law. Nope- I’m a gamblin’ man.

“I’m guessing they sent you guys because I could probably talk my way out of this if you guys were human. Am I right, or am I right?”

Silence, but for the sound of gears rattling and the dull roar of the road.

“And now you’re gonna kill me somewhere and make sure nobody finds me for a while.”

And you know, some great philosopher or lawyer once said something… silence gives assent. I knew the game, and I had an ace up my sleeve, or more accurately, my collar. And for the first time all day – who am I kidding?  all year - I started to feel pretty good.

“Okay, boys- I’m gonna do you all favor. Check my collar really careful-like, ’cause I’m thinking you don’t want me dead as bad as you thought you did…”

And with that somebody slammed on the brakes. Heh. That rattled ‘em enough to get their attention. The blindfold came off gently, and I smiled up at my glowing-green-and-red-eyed captor. I could tell from the look on his poorly-crafted face that he knew exactly what I was talking about. ‘Bot emotions can be hard to read, but even on his crude features I could tell that the only thing he felt at that moment more than disbelief was fear. Very justified fear, too. The thing he saw at that moment was more or less legendary among synthetics, and just the cultural memory of the ShockCollar was enough to keep most robots from thinking about laying a metal finger on a human being. Which, of course, was exactly what I was counting on, and exactly why I wore the jury-rigged thing.

“It’s a funny thing, the ol’ ShockCollars. They’re illegal now, you know, so it’s usually just the rich or famous who have ‘em. But their vitals flatline or they get scared enough and- BOOM!”

They jumped at that and I started laughing.

“Thing is, you know the right connections, you can get one of these bad boys rigged up special. Thing’ll surround you in a field that’ll knock out any human too close and from what I hear they’re fatal one hundred percent of the time when applied to synthetic people… so you don’t wanna piss me off, right?” I let ‘em get a look at my molars.

Everything I was saying was completely true. It was very, very lucky for me that I’d saved the ass of an engineer who happened to deal in old and illegal technology. He’d been a good friend… may Something Out There rest his soul.

“But that’s the thing- if this thing were wired to go off when I was miserable or in pain, I’d have long since blasted everybody in my building.”

They were starting to get it about the moment I started chuckling.

“No, muchacos. This thing’s wired to go off when I think something’s funny as hell.”

I laughed, then I laughed some more; I was in tears by the time the ‘bot facing me had stopped twitching. Twenty minutes later I’d worked my hands free, and I went through the van for clues, spare parts, loose change, whatever. I’d take what I could get, and I could probably use it. Also, if my hunches were correct, I’d get everything I needed to start tracking people down and getting to the morally ambiguous part of the case- the long, drawn-out part to which the routine violence had just been a prologue.

The easy part was over. Thank God. I could get back to the miserable, complicated parts, starting by meeting my client at Sharkness Cafe.

At first I thought he was standing me up. I’d been waiting at Sharkney’s for over an hour and had just decided to leave and call the cops when he strutted in looking more than a little pleased with himself.

“Where the hell have you been- oh my god, what happened?” He had a black eye and a smug smile that seemed to hold at least half the explanation for the bruises.

“Library.” He pulled out a stack of notecards. “Now, here’s what I’ve-”

“You got a black eye at the library?”

“Had a bunch of overdue books. Now look- your dad works for Nocter Pharmaceuticals, right?”

The mention of my father pushed his flimsy explanation to the back of my mind. “Do you know where he is?”

“Nope. No, I am afraid I do not know where he is. That is something of which I am not at the moment certain.” He grabbed the waitress’ sleeve as she passed. “Ah yes I would like a sandwich- the expensive one. Yes, thank you, you’re beautiful. Ah ha ha yes.” He grinned up at her, but when he turned to me he was deadly serious. “Your father may or may not be in incredibly mortal danger, and I may or may not be able to assist you in finding him. In seeking him out, I may or may not uncover some incredibly unpleasant things about some very powerful people, and in doing so may or may not put both of our lives at great risk, which in turn may or may not result in me making a very tidy sum of money regardless of any payment which you may be able to scrounge together. And so I will, in exchange for the very expensive sandwich I am about to eat, lay out to you the information that I have culled from the city’s darkest libraries on this day, I shall hint dramatically to you about the things I shall do with said information, and, finally, I shall dictate the terms of the financial agreement by which we shall abide in the course of our professional relationship.” He tapped his notecards against the edge of the table and raised his eyebrows at me. “Whaddayasay?”

What else can I say, Dick?“Okay.”

He stood up and started pacing. “In the course of my research I have discovered a few very valuable pieces of information, namely regarding a chemical called DMSO.”

“What, like a drug?”

“Nope. It’s a colorless liquid, miscible in water, and tastes like garlicky oysters, according to Wikipedia. It’s what’s called a cryoprotectant- keeps living tissue from being damaged by subzero temperatures. It’s sometimes used in treatment of genitourinary disorders. Killed a woman once in 1965- she didn’t have genitourinary disorders, she had something wrong with her wrist. I mean, she might have had a genitourinary disorder, but it’s very difficult to tell at this point.”

I stared at him blankly.

“DMSO. Dee, Em, Ess, Oh. Dimso.”

“I see…”

“Well, it would be very strange if you did, because I haven’t finished telling you why I’m talking about this random chemical. You should listen more.” He paced past me and almost knocked over my drink.

“Maybe you could stop pacing?”

“Nope. Helps me think. Need to think if we’re gonna find your dad. Go ahead and tell me to stop pacing if you don’t want your dad found. Ah? Thought not. So: DMSO. Innocuous. Boring. Common. And Nocter Pharmaceuticals just ordered about thirty years’ supplies of it- that is, thirty years’ at a genitourinary clinic. I mean a LOT.”

I couldn’t tell if I hated him yet, but I was starting to get a pretty good idea.

“A local firm owned by Nocter also obtained several million dollars’ worth of equipment, of an undetermined purpose and origin. The equipment was shipped on the day your father disappeared and didn’t appear in Nocter expense reports, logs, or tax documents- and Nocter is famously scrupulous about its taxes. You know, ever since the whole fiasco with… okay, you don’t know, but still.”

Okay, so maybe not hate. “I thought you said you went to the library?”

“I lied. So my first order of business is to figure out what they’re doing with the chemicals and the shifty equipment. Then, I gotta figure out who it benefits to get a bunch of genitourinary medication and mysterious equipment and also have your father disappear. I’m probably going to need to read everything your father wrote, researched, blah blah blah I’m gonna need to see his stuff.”

Unless you can hate someone while acknowledging they’re brilliant? That’s the one. “That’s fine. Anything else?”

He’d been seated for a few minutes, but I hadn’t noticed him begin to eat the sandwich. Somehow he’d already disappeared half of it. The man’s just full of clever surprises. Tom Bleakly: He can eat a sandwich while your father suffers an unknown fate!

With his mouth full: “The important thing to consider in this case will be expenses. As has been noted by others in my profession, it is never quite certain what expenses may arise in the course of an investigation, all things being interconnected- but in the interest of the preservation of my integrity, I shall be forthcoming in describing to you all the resources I shall require for this case, and have in fact made a list of costs and estimates for those circumstances which I can foresee- it’s here on this notecard.”

I took the card.

“In the meantime I haven’t a moment to lose and must ask you to simply expect me to call at your home at some point this weekend, quite possibly in some state of injury or intoxication and at a highly inappropriate hour. In such a case I beg you not to panic, be alarmed, or become in any manner dismayed: this is all very official detective protocol which I once again assure you is quite necessary to the safe retrieval of your beloved parent and perhaps the acquisition of funds that could be described as formidable. Well, the latter bit is for me. You get the safe return of your loved one. That’s how it works. And in turn perhaps you will try to kill me by trying to trick me into falling in love with you- but of course I am too clever for such a ruse to succeed. Cigarette?”

I took the cigarette and stood. I growled at him wearily,”It sounds like you know what the hell you’re doing, and you are definitely a creepy, annoying little person. Find my dad and I’ll take care of any and all expenses. At this point I honestly don’t know what to think, so I guess I’ll see you at some highly inappropriate hour this weekend.”

The sandwich was gone and he was on his feet. “Hannah. I know I operate differently than you might expect. I respect that my methods might make you uncomfortable. But I just want you to know that I will find your father, and I will figure out what the hell Nocter and their subsidiaries are up to. And I know it’s asking a lot- but please. For both our good- trust me. If anything goes wrong, call me and tell me exactly where you are. My number’s on the card I gave you.”

For just a second, I thought I saw something really human in his eyes. For just a second, I think I got a taste of the decent guy he could be when he stood still for a goddamned second. Then, he started moving again, throwing his coat over his shoulders, always back into motion, and the moment passed- and again, he was merely a creepy guy who just so happened to be my last chance to see my father again.

So I nodded.

He winked at me and in a puff of flimflam, was gone.

bleakly

I always loved the conveyor sidewalks. I mean, sure, they were outside and you could hardly breathe out there those days, and half the time they were under maintenance- but it really was the only way to see the city. Under the skyscrapers, you looked up at the sky, and on the off chance the clouds were thin enough, it was almost like the buildings were reaching up to embrace the moon.

Most days, of course, it was more like a grimy hand reaching up toward nothing at all.

I got off at an unassuming office building of medium size. The whole thing belonged to Nocter, and the place was a damned fortress- levels of security backing up redundant levels of security, enough funding for a small weapons program, full body-scan… the place was impregnable, and they’d shipped mysterious equipment to this address, equipment that was so secret the stockholders and board of directors had absolutely no idea what it was or how much it had cost.

Sounded to me like the perfect place to poke my head into and try to build on what little I found in the robo-thugs’ van, and what better investigational method than to walk in the front door? I mean, they’d never expect that.

“Bonjour, mon cherie,” I brightly greeted the dark-eyed receptionist, “I must needs be meeting Monsieur- ah, so difficult to pronounce the name-”

“Tkachyov?” She fluttered her eyelashes.

Bingo. “Oui! You are as clever as you are beautiful, Mademoiselle. ‘Tat-chee-yoof is so lucky to have such a, how do you say, talented and worthy lady in his employ. I trust the, ah, appointment is all in order?”

“Mister- I mean Monsieur,” – she blushed prettily – “Bleakly?”

(Their files were pretty secure- as far as such things go. I was lucky I’d been able to hack into the appointment list in her computer without setting off a million alarms.)

“Oui. Merci, my loveliest new acquaintance. I shall, if fortune smiles, see you in time.”

She smiled widely down at her computer screen as I whisked past the desk and into the elevator.

I whistled. I almost didn’t notice my shoulder. I almost didn’t hate the blaring muzak. Hell, I could almost stomach my reflection in the mirror finish of the elevator.

The elevator doors opened and instinctually I reached immediately for the “Door Close” button which of course did me very little good. I pushed it a few more times just in case. Shit.

Four pale identical men stood almost silhouetted by the light from floor 34. So I smiled and put my hands behind my head.

“Well, I’m guessing you guys are gonna take me someplace bad now.”

They wordlessly boarded the elevator, one on either side of me, one standing directly in front of the doors, the fourth leaning in a corner and pushing a series of buttons on the elevator console. It was he who spoke.

“We are the Neithermen.”

“Nice to meet you! I’m Thomas Bleakly, Private-”

“We know. Don’t speak to us.”

“And I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking, hey, I could totally-”

Oh hey, check it out! Stars!

Wait a minute- oh god damn it.

“And I,” spoke the Voice, “am not anyone named anything even remotely close to Tkachyov. You get an A for effort, though.”

Well, that does put a damper on things.

“You’ve been pretty cheerful about this investigation, Bleakly. You really have. Which is stupid, considering your smarts and your record. Your reputation alone’s probably enough to make you a rich man, which says some things about you. Namely, that you’re an idiot.”

I started wheezing. My spirits started rising.

“You think yourself invulnerable. You tend to solve cases through brute force, by putting yourself in the middle and assuming your indestructible ass or impossible good luck will get you through.”

I almost chuckled. C’mon, Bleakly. This is pretty fucking funny. Right? Gimme a decent laugh.

And hey, it was almost funny. It started to get funnier by the second. “And you’ve got me tied down right now because I’m known for talking my way out of this shit. Right?”

“You assume… many things, Thomas. This is your greatest weakness, I’ve no problem telling you.”

I started laughing in earnest. “You seem to know a lot about my weaknesses. But just… maybe… you’re missing a couple of my strengths.” I smiled up at the tiled ceiling and concentrated on guffawing, chuckling, giggling.

“I suppose it’s only fair I explain something to you. But first-”

And his unknowing monologue was enough to push me over the edge. I cracked up.

Hey, check it out! Stars!

Oh MOTHERFUCKER.

“Do you know why they outlawed the ShockCollar, Bleakly?”

At this point, I’m pretty sure my brain was on “Record-only” mode. I didn’t respond. I didn’t want to respond. I was having a pretty bad day, and for me… for me, that’s saying a lot. ‘I was having a bad day,” said the guy for whom having a good day meant throwing up less than twice and not getting shot at.

So yeah. If I responded, it was probably by spitting up blood.

“The ShockCollar was always a very half-assed sort of weapon. Basically a low-grade stun grenade that just so happened to be powered by the person wearing it. No, it wasn’t a very dangerous weapon, despite the indoctrination they still put into ‘bots to this day.” The owner of the voice ran unseen fingertips along my face. “The ShockCollar didn’t just monitor vitals. It monitored thoughts. And that, mon cherie- that is truly a dangerous thing. International law passed months after they were released. Couldn’t have technology so intimately acquainted with the users’ brain, oh no.”

A reptilian smile. No, an imagined reptilian smile. I could hear it. I could smell it.

“The perceived danger, and in fact the findings of no fewer than eight studies by very highly respected and very well funded laboratories, was the possibility that the collars could be reverse-engineered to stimulate specific areas of the brain in reaction to specific cues in the brain itself. As in, you think Pavlov’s dog was under control? Just wait until you collar people with this puppy. Outlawing the collars was probably the last really smart thing the World Council did before the end. Yes sir-ree.”

Thomas Bleakly, Private Eye.

“Now, let’s take a look at some motives and intentions, shall we? Let’s see here. I believe, and please correct me if I’m wrong, that you are currently in the, ah, employ of one Hannah Smith, daughter of one David Smith. It has been in my best interests for you to not inquire about Mister Smith. It would now be in your best interests not to inquire about Mister Smith. In short, my good man, the next time you attempt to help, assist, or in any way aid Hannah or David Smith, your very own, newly modified ShockCollar, which now resides just under the skin of your neck, will produce a focused beam into an area of your brain that will cause you to… one moment, let me find it on the list… ah, yes. It will cause you to suffer violent and terrifying hallucinations.”

Well that ain’t so bad.

“If you attempt to harm or incapacitate any Nocter employee in any way, or if you speak to one of my Neithermen, the collar will produce a strong sedative effect, as you have just discovered for yourself.”

Gotta look on the bright side, right?

“You’re a lucky man, Bleakly. You’re lucky that I’m not prudent or simple. Because, if I was, you’d be dead. You’re lucky that you have such a reputation, and that I am neither weak nor stupid- it will, after all, be far simpler to assume that a half-mad man has gone the whole way, than to believe that the Collars still exist and can so easily be modified. Well, not so easily. I happen to have some very well-paid and very brilliant minds at my disposal.

“Of course, should you try to appeal to any sort of authority, I believe there is a dead engineer whose family is currently both comfortable and alive. Should anyone learn of the existence of your collar, my child- I’m sure they would cease to be so comfortable. Bleakly, I am not sure how alive they would remain…”

I need a drink.

“Well, I believe this is all the time I have to waste with you. I bequeath you now unto the streets. Oh, and don’t forget- we’ve left a few more surprises in that collar. You shall have quite the adventure locating all its little quirks. Now-”

I think I should start naming these stars. Oh, well…

What was that word? The last thing I heard? It was… It was…

Oh, I remember now, it was-

“Bleuuughh huck ffffck pppt.” I posited thoughtfully. After some consideration, I rejoined, “Unh- uhggrrroooouuullllghk. Fccck ppt. Pppt.”

Try not to hyperventilate there. Oh my god I need a drink.

Hm.

And that, kids, is the story of how I vomited up my gallbladder in a back alley.

The next thing I tried to do, naturally, was dig out the Collar with my fingernails. The thing that happened to my brain next is something that will haunt me for the rest of my life and which, with my apologies, I omit here.

I woke up two days later, face-down in the scum that collects on the floors of restrooms in bars of sufficient dinginess. I pushed myself up from the floor and realized I’d been using broken bits of mirror as a pillow.

I have to call Smith-

In that instant, each piece of the broken mirror beneath me shifted- a thousand eyes an acid searing gaze godDAMN

-TO TELL HER I CAN’T HELP HER EVER. IN FACT SHE WILL PROBABLY BE SADDENED AND MADE INFINITELY REMORSEFUL BY MY CALL.

The moment faded and lots of little Tom Bleaklies looked up at me from the bloodstained glass. The sight was not a large improvement on the demon eyes.

Well, maybe I’ll be a little helpful.

hannah

I stayed up ’till three in the morning, partly because I couldn’t sleep, and partly because I had a premonition that Bleakly might call at such an hour.
At three forty-five my phone rang.
“Bleakly?”
“Hannah.”
“Have you found my dad?”
“No, and nobody can or ever will. Don’t try to contact me again.”
The line went dead.
Five minutes of shock, five minutes of cursing, and ten minutes of tears later, the phone rang again.
“You son of a bitch-”
“Hannah.”
My voice caught and, I couldn’t help it, I started sobbing. “Are… are you okay?”
“No. And Hannah?”
“Y…Yes?”
“Thank you very much for the sandwich. Goodbye.”
I dropped the phone. I had no one left to call.
I was alone with nothing but a tearstorm so fierce I was afraid – no, I hoped – it would tear me apart.
I was lost in the dark.

bleakly

I was holed up in one of the few places I knew I would be really safe. I was in the dirtiest part of the city’s worst slum, where there are just two types of people who don’t get ripped off and torn apart: the synth-juicers with arms bigger around than my chest… and the insane. Luckily for me, I fell into the latter category.
I was alone with a few square feet to myself, in a place where the types of noises I planned to make would not be questioned or investigated.
My name is Thomas Bleakly, and I’m a detective. It’s who I was. It’s what I was. And with a shackle around my throat – a subdermal collar whose only function was to stimulate the parts of my brain that tell me the world is burning down if at any point I should try to do my job as a detective – I was less than nothing.
The ShockCollar, originally a defense measure of my own, was modified and installed in my neck by the enemies of my latest client. If at any point I knowingly did anything that would in any way assist Hannah Smith or her missing father, I would be subjected to intense and violent hallucinations.
Which brought me back to the room with no electricity and holes in the walls.
Time to test this fucking collar’s boundaries.
In Michael Crichton’s novel The Terminal Man, a patient is described whose brain is treated with mild electric shocks to his pleasure centers whenever he begins to have a seizure. His brain, locked in a logarithmic learning curve, began to seize more often until it burned out entirely.
Well, the good news is that brains can learn.
After a week of slamming myself against the edge of my reality, I could barely fit inside my head. I had bruises on my thoughts.
I remembered- A red mist of violence – punching glass, flesh hanging in shreds from my knuckles. Headbutting a brick wall, gnawing the insides of my mouth, slamming my elbow into concrete. Exerting every fiber of my being to penetrate the veil between my eyes and the real world.
I’d been to Hell and back.
I drank a shot of whiskey. Then I did it again.
Starting to find the boundaries. Given, I’m having some slight difficulty determining what is and is not real. But if anything my powers of observation and deduction feel… enhanced. Sharper. Can’t say the same for my short-term memory. Where was I? Where am I?
I hit the street and lit a cigarette. Considering what I’d been through, I felt… good. Cleansed. I could think Hannah’s name without cringing.
I decided to do a test run on my powers of observation, deduction, and sneaky movement by stealing someone’s wallet; I needed booze money.
This guy’s big. I’ll try blackmail first.
“Excuse me, I say pardon me sir!”
He was a synth-juicer. His eyes had sunken into his face, but his neck, all muscle, was thicker than his jaw. He was at least two feet taller than me. The look on his face as he turned to look at me communicated in a single glare what an infinite number of gorillas could never render, even with an infinite number of keyboards.
I took a stab in the dark. “I had a question for you. About her.”
Nope, he just looked pissed off that I existed. “What. Do. YOU. WANT?” He bared his teeth, but honestly just his breath would’ve been enough to scare me off. (This was impressive, considering that everything smelled like meat to me at the time.)
The guy was big and slow and angry. It wasn’t going to work out like I hoped, so I put a stupid grin on my face to confuse him long enough to think through how I could best turn his animal rage to my advantage.
New plan: This man is a Nocter Employee. Pretend this guy is a Nocter employee. This guy is a Nocter employee and I’m gonna kick him in the nuts. (This was not the height of my decision-making career, but the sidewalk suggested that it might be a decent idea, and the sidewalk had been decent to me in the past.)
The instant the top of my foot came into contact with the little lump bulging in the bodybuilder’s pants I could feel the collar mildly trying to put me out, doing its job to sedate me if I attacked a member of the company. I mean, I knew the guy wasn’t with Nocter. But I figured (or at least, in retrospect, I belive this was my plan) any opportunity to fight the collar’s effects would bring me a step closer to being myself again. I ran and ran and ran and ran, adrenaline fighting the collar, the collar fighting me, and a roaring swarm of bees chasing me. (Or maybe it was the synth-juicer. Either way, it was really scary.)
Finally, after running and breathing and stars and vomit and some other things I don’t remember, I was safe, and I had his wallet. He hadn’t even noticed, but in his defense, he was fairly busy getting kicked in the nuts while I went through his pockets.
A moment of triumph. I felt like myself again, or as close as I could get with the universe fracturing around me. It was the little persistent touches that weirded me out. Little details, like the buildings bleeding and the way that cars screamed. Those were mild hallucinations my brain was maintaining to keep me tuned in to one reality – and the collar wasn’t helping. It could kind of tell I liked Hannah.
I bought booze and ran full-force at the wall in my head.

bleakly

Forty-eight hours later:
I’m not entirely sure what I was doing beneath a bridge with a car battery in my lap and a jumper cable attached to one ear, but I’m guessing either it was my idea of therapy or else I was trying to burn out the ‘collar, and since just thinking about the latter made me twitch… Yeah, I don’t think I’m going to be able to voluntarily or intentionally remove or destroy the collar. It ain’t gonna happen. But just maybe…
I heard footsteps.
Oh, look. Neithermen.
I was righteously pissed off as well as out of my fucking mind. I was a pillar of rage. The Neithermen: suited cronies of the corporation that screwed over my last client, the beautiful ‘bot. Agents of the organization that drove a spike into my mind.
So I did the valorous thing and discretioned my ass out of there.
Forty-eight hours later:
The room burst into flames, since I knew full-well the call I was making was for Hannah. I had a long way to go before I could help her directly… but for now I could do one thing. I could call an old friend.
Gregory Jacobson. One hundred twenty-six years old, white beard to his waist, and at one point a brilliant detective. Hopefully he could keep Hannah alive until I could admit to myself I wanted to help her without the walls screaming at me.
Ring. Ring. Ring. Pick up, Greg.
“Hello?”
“Greg. It’s Bleakly.”
“Tommy? Tommy, is that really you?”
“It’s really me, Jake. How you been holding up?”
“Good, good. You sound like shit.”
“I feel like shit, too. Listen, Greg- I’m in some trouble.”
“You need a place to stay? You got it.”
I grinned. “Nothing like that right now. At least, not for me. No, I need you… I…. need…. you…. to….” Fingers were reaching through the phone at me. The ground was quaking. I needed to beat the collar…
“What is it, Tom? Tom? You there?”
“I… need… check your… handheld. Data- help… HELP HER.” I could feel nausea rising in the back of my throat. “HELP HANNAH SMI-” was all I could say.
Forty-eight hours later:
I’d done all I could for her. I needed a foothold.


bleakly


To start with, I decided to build a tolerance to hallucinogens. And not a physical tolerance, either- I was going to build a psychic tolerance. My brain was going to be hallucination-proof. Iron-clad. I was not going to lose hold of reality… at least, not of a reality. I just needed consistency. If I was dealing with one consistent reality, I could operate as a detective. It doesn’t matter what I think a clue is as long as I still know how to follow my leads and trust my instincts.



Fuck, this’d be easier with a Learning Coil. Too bad those are outlawed too. Good going, getting involved with Mindscan tech at all… real good going, Bleakly.


I kicked the asses of five drug dealers to get-


Acid, Ketamine, Ecstasy, Rip-Run, Easygo, Peyote, Multiverse, Salvia, Nutmeg, Absinthe, Nitrous Oxide, Synapse-Rape-In-A-Bottle, and mushrooms.


It’d take me a couple weeks to try each one. Then I’d start with combinations. It’s a good thing my handheld is indestructible. I went through the drugs and threw away a small fortune in junk, dope, smack, and dogshit. Another addiction was not what I needed.


Forty-eight hou- wait. No, it was twenty minutes later. Or was it?


When I was done sorting out what was left, I had eight pill bottles on the floor beside the mattress.


I shaved, brushed my teeth, and washed my face before returning to the ancient mattress. I tried to find anything good on the holovision, but even with three thousand channels, as the old saying goes… nothing’s on.


I was as ready as I was ever going to be. I opened my mouth and swallowed the contents of the first bottle.

I didn’t know what to think when Tom called me.


“G.. Greg?”


“Tom? Thomas Bleakly?”


“MOTHERFUCK SHIT ASS WHORE.”


“I know you are, but what am I?”


“Something important, Jake. I can’t talk about it on the phone. Very important. Text message. Yes. That is what I will do. You must help her. Hannah.You really really need to help her, she needs someone to help her. Big case. Really busy.”


“Tom, I’d be happy to-”


“Thanks. You’re awesome. I love you. I gotta go eat some pieces of glass.” And he hung up.


Luckily, I didn’t need to know much- he sent me a text message with an address and the words “HELP HER.” There are few people I have met in my fifty-two years who I trust absolutely, but Thomas Bleakly is one of them. So I went.


I knocked and a tear-stained woman opened the door. I smiled warmly at her.


“Hannah, I presume? I’m Gregory Jacobson. Thomas sent me. I’m here to help.”



bleakly

I didn’t wake up. The reason I didn’t wake up is that I wasn’t dreaming to begin with.
So I’m an idiot. I made it worse. I… I guess hallucinations don’t work like I thought they did?
Because the amount of control I have on reality is… excuse me, I’m trying to talk. It’s very rude of you to put your spiky penises near my face when I’m talking.
And hey, look! Neithermen!
“Hey, guys, I…fu…”ck I forgot. Can’t talk to the Neithermen. Or else the collar passes me out.
Oh, man. Stars. I remember you guys. There’s Hector, there’s Steve, and who can forget Bonnie! Hey, where are you guys going? Guys?
Man, just when you get used to stars…
The T-6 ShockCollar was originally a defensive device. It incorporated Mindscan Technology such that the collar would emit electromagnetic radiation into the skulls of anyone within a fifteen-foot radius whenever certain thoughts were triggered. The collars could be set to mental activation codes, vital signs, or emotional triggers.
When it was discovered that MindScan technology had the potential to destroy human civilization, it was banned by the World Council. As a consequence, very little is known about MindScan technology.
It is a little-known (in fact, almost totally unknown) fact the effects of the collars can be resisted by strong-willed individuals who are subjected to the field effect of the collars repeatedly over time.
It is for this reason that I regained my faculties of hearing at this juncture. And with that, I was once again in business. Yesss. Thomas Bleakly, Professional Badass and Private Investi- holy shit, what did he just say?
I had a problem. I could hear the Neithermen speaking with their boss. But I couldn’t move. Hell, I couldn’t open my eyes. I got a foothold on the collar, but it’s still in charge.
I could hear. That was a good thing. Anything to give me an edge, a foothold, a scrap of information to close this case. No, my problem was that the things I was hearing, while enlightening, were very, very, very bad… and the only person who could help me I couldn’t speak to without hallucinating.
Doesn’t matter anyway. I can’t move.
I can’t move, and I’m going to die.

jacobson


I did my best to calm and comfort her. I made tea, brought a blanket in from my car, and began mentally compiling any scrap of information that could help me figure out exactly what was wrong with Thomas. She finished telling me what she knew over a cup of tea. She told me everything- she’d gone to Bleakly, Bleakly had poked around. She’d bought him a sandwich.

He liked her, and it wasn’t hard to see why. She was earnest, intelligent, and heartbroken.

I shook my head. “The question is, where is he now? I know he hasn’t abandoned you or your father. I know Tom. He wouldn’t abandon a case. ” Especially not with a beautiful, heartbroken woman involved.

She stared off into space. “The only things he talked about when I met him at the cafe were… chemical names, weird history. Tax documents.”

I chuckled softly. “That’s what most of detectiving is, darling. Boring. Paperwork, history, seemingly random facts. It’s not all that sensational kiss, kiss, bang bang stuff.”

“But he was so weird. He said he’d been to the library. He had a black eye.”

I puffed out my cheeks and exhaled. “That… that sounds like Tom, all right. Did he tell you anything specific? Any leads he found?”

A moment, and then she looked almost startled. “Um… yeah. Actually. He wouldn’t stop talking about this chemical, D.M.S. something.”

“He found a single chemical interesting enough to talk to you about it? It was a lead in his case?”

She looked at me. “I didn’t think he meant it was anything serious. It seemed like he was trying to impress me, or…”

“That’s fine, dear. Just tell me what you can about this chemical, and if it’s all right, I’d like to look at anything your father left…”

“Yeah. Sure.”

She took me to her fathers’ study. From an educated glance, it was very clear that the man was gone and did not intend to return. A well-worn coat-hook was vacant, some very carefully organized papers had been roughly tossed aside, things had been gathered up hurriedly: the man believed that he was in danger, or that there was some emergency.

I located some folders that appeared be some of the few that Smith routinely used. They were empty, of course. Smith didn’t want to be followed or found.

I scanned the bookshelves in the study. Old man Smith had been something of a polymath- a regular Major General. He had shelves devoted to advanced mathematics, quantum physics, biology, chemistry, history, psychology- old books and new.

I pulled a book at random and flipped through. The book was no more than a year old, going by the copyright date, but it was filled with notes, bookmarks, and underlined words. I slid it back into place and selected a volume on cellular biology. It, too, was filled with notes, but unlike the other, parts of the book were crossed out and replaced. I looked again at the cover: “Molecular Cell Biology, Volume Three: A Practical Reference, by Thurston and Smith.” I idly wondered how much of the library was the work of the man himself.

Having exhausted the room for any relevant thread of interest, I sat at his desk and accessed his computer terminal.

I sat at his computer and turned to Hannah, who had stood silently in the doorway.

“The chemical’s name, if you can recall?”

She couldn’t remember the whole thing, but she remembered enough. A description of the chemical’s properties and a few of its initials were enough for me to locate it in an online medical library. It was a lucky thing Bleakly had given her that much.

DMSO. Used to treat urinogenital infections, some types of nerve damage, and a cryoprotectant.

“Hannah, do you know what sort of work your father was doing at the time he disappeared?”

She shook her head. “Everything he worked on had wide ranges of applications, lots of it technical. Sometimes he’d say, ‘This could cure cancer,’ or ‘This will revolutionize the transportation industry,’ or something, but most of the time he’d just go on about differentials and equations and temperatures and doers, whatever those are.”

“Dewars? Cryogenics… I wonder.”

“What?”

“Well, these days, freezing things and people isn’t exactly a big business… but it seems like Nocter’s either very interested in freezing things or people. Or, they all have terrible urinary infections.”

She smiled slightly for the first time since I’d seen her. I might’ve been getting older, but deep down, I was still a PI and above all a gentleman.

Bleakly had told Hannah about the chemical D.M.S.O. for a reason. Cryoprotectant plus large investment in strange machinery equals… something important. Hopefully the key to the case, and to saving Bleakly’s ass.

I searched the computer for anything with the words ‘dmso’ or ‘cryogenic.” I found nothing.

Again: ‘dewar,’ ‘temperature,’ ‘lab.’ Nothing.

I had a thought, and searched ‘nocter’ and ‘cryo.’

I found a small text document in a hidden directory marked ‘nocter/cryo/HANNAH.txt.’

The file contained one sentence:

‘Beware the Neithermen.’

bleakly


I was being carried. Every part of me was tingling and I had trouble putting one thought in front of another. I almost wished I had all my old problems.

My non-acquaintance the monologuer was very busy yelling at someone at about the point I’d recovered enough of myself to hear.“We’ve got no use for him anymore. He’s gone totally starkers, anyone could see that. He won’t be missed. Make him disappear.”

There’s monologue guy… They have no use for me? Meaning…

“Ha, no. No, no, no, no, and categorically, NO, you fucktard, you are missing the point.He contacted Smith’s daughter, who knows what she knows?”

Not the monologuer, now. Someone else. Someone… familiar? I feel like I’d know that voice anywhere. But whose is it? It’s… it’s…

” They are collectively a greater threat than you are apparently capable of seeing.“

“One wrong note, anything to tip her off, and BAM. She’s useless. She burns out. She’sprogrammed to. Follow Bleakly. Monitor the daughter. And don’t fuck this up. Ah, the man of the hour. Give him here.”

I was lifted up onto some kind of table. I struggled to open my eyes, but the collar either wasn’t forgiving me for speaking to the Neithermen, or there was something else acting on me. Hell, it could be the drugs. Great going. Way to prove the old kid’s shows right. Just say no, kids.

“He’s been erratic. But he’s been out of contact with everyone, for the most part. Still safe until we need him.”

A new voice. Cold. Soft. “And if something should go wrong?”

The familiar one replied. “We have prepared for that contingency.”

Where the hell do I know that voice from? He’s… he’s touching my neck. What is he-

And I heard no more and felt no more.

———
Jacobson couldn’t have come at a more perfect time. He was warm and understanding… he reminded me of my father.

He searched the house, asking questions, taking notes. Unlike Bleakly, he seemed to have a method. Everything he did made sense.

Until his cell phone rang.

“Hello? Dear God, Tom, where? What?”

His jaw dropped.

“Judas? The Judas? I see. Very well.”

He looked at me with more sadness in his eyes than I was prepared to expect from this calm, gentlemanly octogenarian. “We need to leave. Immediately. We’ll be meeting with Thomas.”

I followed him into the night, locking the front door as quickly as I could. ”What’s going on? Who’s Judas?”

Even in his haste he held open the car door for me. “He’s someone from whom Thomas would not ask a favor unless he found it absolutely necessary to do so. They were friends, once.”

“And why are we going to him now?” I barely fastened my seat-belt before he ran a red light and two stop signs.

“Because, my dear, in Judas’ care is the very last place anyone who knows anything about Thomas Bleakly would think to search for him. And the people who are searching for him will be looking for you directly.”

The first few drops of rain started to hit the windshield. Jacobson clicked the wipers on.

The wipers thrummed and the rain pattered and music whispered lightly from the radio.

Jacobson pulled onto the highway and exhaustion covered me like a warm blanket.

I dreamed of my father. His smile, his absent-minded days, the way he’d get lost in his books and his equations.

I dreamed about one day in particular, after my father had spent a weekend locked up in his study and when he came out, he’d written me a piece of music. It was elegant and moving and I could play it effortlessly on piano, but he pulled out his old guitar and awkwardly plucked the strings, trying to keep the rhythm of the piece he’d written himself. I’d laughed and hugged him and he spent the rest of the evening by the fire, tinkering on the guitar and singingly softly to himself and me.

I miss you.

Wait.

Okay, that was a lie.

I heard murmurs.

Perhaps I was approaching the situation from the wrong angle.

It was simple, really. Everyone in the room was a lizard-person, after all.

Wait- what?

Yes, they were all lizard-people.  Lizard people have one great weakness:

Their eyes.

The two lizards looking down at me hissed like hot coals the second I opened my eyes.

This isn’t happening. But if I saw what’s really happening, my mind would break.

Shall we go?

The eyes.

I had to target the eyes, then run like hell.

THEIR EYES

The stairwell. Think. Stairwell.

I was already there. Lizard spit sailed over my shoulder – No, that’s a bullet. RUN.

Running, tumbling down stairs- same thing, right? I wasn’t planning on using my bones for anything anytime soon anyway.

You have a gun. Remember?

Of course. I will shoot them in the eyes.

Actually anywhere on their body works fine

Shut up.

I’ll shut up when you quit giggling. Psycho.

I’ll quit giggling after I jump through this giant… thing… made of… glass…

Window?

Yes. That. I will stop giggling once I jump through the window.

No you won’t.

I know.

Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

Cover your head.

Contingencies were incredibly important in my line of work. I hadn’t very many friends left, but dammit, I was ready for the unexpected.

Judas was all-out final call last-resort plan zero.

I’d written a special program for my handheld years before, designed for one-time-use-only. It was an incredibly complete level of encryption, really remarkable, and impossible to decipher so long as I used it just the one time- and when I wrote it I planned to use it exactly never. Thing is, I can never resist a great contingency. 

The program would send a tight-beam transmission from my handheld to the closest thing connected to a networked device- like someone’s toaster oven. That device would search for another, similar device elsewhere on the network, specifically somewhere near an abandoned factory in the southernmost part of town. The toaster oven or whatever on the far end would beam the transmission directly to Judas.

When I woke up in a soot-covered alley with brand new bruises and the knowledge that the lovely Miss Smith was in danger, my first thought was, of course, Fuck. No choice but to use Plan Zero.

My second thought was, Where the hell am I gonna get another contingency plan that good?

I entered a very long access code into my handheld, and by some fluke nothing went wrong. The program connected.

“Judas, it’s me.”

“That really you, Bleakly? Or should I call you Pilate?” It was weird hearing his voice after… God, I have no idea how long.

“I never had as many friends as you. Nicknames don’t stick.” True enough. But I had my reasons for shedding old monikers.

“Shame. It was a snappy thing we had going.”

“We don’t have long to talk.” I patted my pockets, hoping what I needed was still there.

“Of course not. You’re calling me. You put your life in danger every day, so the only time you’d break down and call me is if a beautiful woman’s life was in danger. And you know full well I can never resist a damsel in distress.”

“It’s a beautiful robot. But still.” Left coat pocket? Yes. I have them. “Do you still have that old Cold War bunker? With the Faraday cage?”

“You need it.” Not a question.

“I’ve probably got a tracking device implanted somewhere on me. It runs on bio-energy, which is lucky for me, since I’ve got a pocket full of Thann.”

“I’ll send someone to pick you up. I’ll tell them to pick up a dead body where exactly?”

I told him the location and got ready behind a dumpster, so I wouldn’t be seen from the street. The last thing I needed was some dumb cop picking up my “dead” body and waking to scare the crap out of the autopsy technicians…

Thann. It’s the drug they sell to kids who want to have near-death experiences. Flatlines you for a couple hours. In my case it’d shut down anything in my collar they were using to track me, for just long enough to get under the cover of Judas’ really impressive off-the-radar anti-government anti-nuclear self-sustaining underground bunker from which he operated a small smuggling empire.

I swallowed the pills and waited for them to take effect.

Alright. Hard part’s done. I’ve swallowed my pride, now all I have to do is swallow this and die… for a while.

 

 

 

Then I caught fire.

Hannah and I took a little over an hour to reach Judas’ headquarters. She passed out almost immediately; she could hardly be blamed, since she’d been getting nothing but bad news for twenty-four hours, and barely half an hour of sleep during that.

I spent the whole time checking the mirrors, looking for any sign we were being followed. Doctor Smith’s final message had left me plenty uneasy- and if Thomas had resorted to contacting Judas, things had to be very bad. I knew full-well Judas could be trusted, but very little made sense. 

Neithermen. What the blazes… I hope to God Tom has some answers.

It was still raining when we arrived at the old warehouse. It’d been years since I’d seen the place, but little had changed. It still looked deserted, rusted-out. Unfit for existence, much less human use.

Though it didn’t look it, the place was a veritable fortress. Police were bribed to stay outside a two-block radius. Any homeless who wandered too close strangely disappeared. If you’d stayed in the same neighborhood long enough, you’d see the same cars driving by again, slowly. It was invisibly guarded but guarded nonetheless.

Thomas knows what he’s doing… or else we’re doomed anyway.

I pulled up to the front entrance of the warehouse. I saw someone and rolled down the window.

An elderly man carrying a wrench walked towards us. “Hello, hello. Can I help you two with anything? Are you lost?” He smiled vacantly. Old bastard’s probably packing enough heat to ah, hell with it.

“We’re here to see Judas. Bleakly sent us.”

The smile vanished from the man’s face. He produced a pocket radio, stepped back a few feet, and spoke in low tones without taking his eyes from us. He straightened up, but his face relaxed. “All right, then. Drive in there, park around the right. There’s an elevator in the back, you won’t miss it- it’s the only thing isn’t covered in rust.”

I pulled into the warehouse. It almost seemed bigger on the inside than the outside- a great synthetic cavern kept in existence only as camouflage. The perfect hiding place: an empty shell.

I roused Hannah and took her to the elevator. 

Before I could call the elevator a black car sped through the front entrance, stopping feet from us. Two of Judas’ thugs climbed out- I recognized one of them. Harry. From the old days.

Recognition flickered across the Irishman’s face for a split second before it returned to panic. “Oi! Help us out here- he’s thrashin’ around like he’s having a goddamn seizure!”

He opened the back door and the man in the back fell out, laughing like a maniac.

Like the most brilliant maniac I know.

Thomas smiled up at me, even as he scrabbled at the ground. His nose was bleeding and frankly he looked dangerous.

He spoke anyway. “Happy to see me, you fucking beautiful asshole?”

hannah

Seconds after Jacobson shook me awake, everything went to hell. I guessed we were wherever the Private Eye said to go, but beyond that I had no idea where we were- and then a black car came out of nowhere and people started shouting and running and I saw Thomas and he looked like he’d been shot but he was laughing and thrashing and it was horrible and I didn’t know what to do so I just stood by the elevator while everyone else rushed in.

Everything was blurred, Jacobson came back for me, someone said something about a medic. Then the Irish guy-

“We’ve got a doctor – next floor down, ‘e patches us up, there’ll be no problem at all Tommy boy, he’s used to this shit-’

And we were there, underground, in a twisting maze of industrial hallways and well-decorated rooms, and then we were in a cold medical bay, there was more yelling and people were holding him down and Jacobson was telling the medic “Hold off the painkillers, he’s been drugged.”

And Bleakly wheezed “Job hazard, at least when you’re fighting a pharmaceutical company. GREG.”

“Yes, my boy. I’m here.”

“Just you. Sorry lovely Miss Smith-”

jacobson
I nodded to Hannah and she walked over to the corner. Poor girl.

“What is it, Thomas? What happened?”

“Neithermen picked me up. But I shot them. I shot their eyes.” He was panting- it was hard to tell how much pain he was actually in. Something chemical had definitely done a number on him.

“Who are the Neithermen, Thomas?”

“Motherfuckers.”

“I gathered as much. What did they dose you with, my boy?”

“Fuck… call… er,” he mumbled, then succumbed to unconsciousness.

I ran a hand across his forehead. He’s burning up.

I barked at the medic, a rodent-like man who quietly tended Thomas’ wounds. Hardly the most professional character one might wish to encounter in such a situation, but knowing Judas, the man was no doubt highly talented.

I nodded to Hannah, took her hand, and led her out of the medical bay. “Come, darling. Judas is waiting.”

Judas’ room was small and well-lit. His quarters were austere- clean to a fault, reeking of cleaning solutions. The only things atop his small desk were small notecards, some blank, some scribbled upon. The man himself was dark-skinned, of a muscular build, and capable of a blindingly toothy smile, though he didn’t smile when we entered his room. He was hunched in a corner, working on one computer while another scrolled through lists of indecipherable text. He didn’t look up when we entered.

“Have you forgiven him, Judas?”

He still didn’t look up. “What is there to forgive? He and I have done our penances, in our own ways. And so we shall go on.”

“It’s… good to see you, lad.”

With that, his charisma came on like a light switch. He stood and smiled brilliantly. “And you, Professor.”

I chuckled. “I believe I’ve asked you to refrain from addressing me in that manner. It makes me feel old.”

“But of course, Doctor. And you, milady.” He directed his attentions to Hannah. “Who might you be? Thomas never made it a regular habit to gain the company of beautiful women…”

“She is his client. Her father has gone missing, and Nocter Pharmaceuticals is involved.”

Judas’ gaze did not waver, nor did his smile falter. “I believe I was addressing the lady, Jacobson.” He stepped forward to shake her hand. “So. You sought Bleakly’s employ?”

Some of the confusion and fear that had taken refuge in her features fled at the sound of his words. “I’d heard things…”

“How lucky he is that his reputation remains intact, if it brought him into your acquaintance. And speaking of our eponymous hero, how is he? He took quite a beating last chapter.”

“Pardon?” It seems there’s madness going around and I’m the only one immune.

“It is nothing. Let me see how Bleakly is holding up. I’ll have some food prepared. Go ahead, my men will show you to my dining suite. I’ll join you directly.”

——
bleakly
Taking Thann may not have been the smartest thing I have ever done.

Apparently one of the surprises I’d been warned about involved sedatives. They’d been a step ahead of me, after all. Which meant that Nocter knew exactly where I was, even if the tracking signal from my collar couldn’t escape Judas’ fortress. Well at least I’m not on fire anymore. And I was relatively safe.

“Quite a time you’ve been having. Just three chapters in and you’ve done nothing but get your ass kicked. You need to work with them. With Smith and Jacobson.”

“Judas. But…” I spent a moment coughing. “But the danger… to them. And the collar–”

“Oh, come now. Hannah can always be repaired. And should Jacobson go out, it’ll just consist of a touching father-son type dialogue in which he tells you to go get ‘em. And you shall. And the collar is a minor annoyance at the most. You’ve got the thing beat, old friend.”

“I’m wounded.” What is it that’s making my instincts rebel? Different than danger. Worse.

“Yes, but I’ve made preparations. Hannah and Gregory will believe they’ve spent over a month recuperating. Really, I just want to heal you and send you out to kick ass.

“So I heal you with a blessing: Go forth and be Hardcore.”

And I was Hardcore.

jacobson

I met with Judas as he left the medical bay.

“Judas, my boy, there’s something we need to discuss.” I pulled out my notes and adjusted my bow tie.

“Absolutely, Professor.” Judas looked preoccupied… but I needed to know-

“What do you know about the Neithermen?”

 

Judas stopped in his tracks. “Where did you hear that name? From whom?”

“In Smith’s study. The man left some sort of warning, and Bleakly mentioned the same goons. They’re obviously in Nocter’s employ,” I explained, shaking my head, “but they seem to be working for somebody else. I can’t find anything about them.”

Judas started walking again. “The Neithermen are a legend. They were supposedly an elite squad of agents created during the Cold War- Secret Secret Service, you could say. An international, privately owned security firm that answered to no one and dealt primarily in worst-case scenarios. The nuclear ones. Their existence was highly illegal and so they did not exist.”

“You seem to know a lot about them, for legendary creatures…”

“You see, the Neithermen didn’t just contract themselves… they contracted their progeny. A contract with the Neithermen would span generations. Bloodlines, dynasties, corporations could be protected wholesale. Essentially we’re talking indentured servitude at a very, very high price and with very, very deadly stakes. The Neithermen never existed, and if they’ve appeared, it means things are very, very bad for us.”

I grimaced. “I understand. Have you explained this to Bleakly?”

Judas raised his eyebrows and laughed uproariously. “Thomas Bleakly? I? Presume to tell him something he undoubtedly already knows? The man is a genius, Gregory. Let us not insult him. He has his ways, and I have mine. Now, let us dine- and let us not disturb our troubled Miss Smith. I fear she has enough to deal with at the moment.”

“Quite right… I do hope Thomas recuperates quickly…”

 hannah

“Dining suite,” he said. What an understatement.

It was a great hall, hung with drapes and sweetly perfumed with the mildest touch of incense.

Judas was, frankly, amazing. He was thoughtful, he was utterly devoted to my comfort, and, most of all, he was concerned.

Bleakly had asked me random questions about my father. Jacobson had asked very official-sounding questions, if in a very grandfatherly way.

But Judas, with his ivory smile, and sometimes incredibly focused and solemn features- he was different. Over dinner, he asked me all about my father. Whatever it was- the quiet rhythm of his carefully-chosen words, the way he paid perfect attention whenever I spoke- well, for the first time since I’d seen my father, it felt like somebody actually cared what happened to my dad- Jacobson had been wonderful and grandfatherly, but Judas asked curiously about things that Bleakly would have somehow guessed. He was human.

And he was rich as hell. Every time my glass emptied, it seemed magically to fill again; the air was never empty, but when conversation lulled, a man entered and played violin masterfully.

Jacobson sat gruffly in silence.

“It’s hard to think it’s been a month,” I said. “It feels like we’ve been here… days, if that.”

He smiled knowingly. “Time has a way of… slipping through one’s grasp. Especially when one has little to remember it by… or at least, less than one would like.”

A great thunk reverberated throughout the hall and Bleakly strode toward the table. He seemed like a new man- the bruises and cuts were gone, his hat and coat were clean… but his grin was as insane as ever.

Judas raised his glass. “Thomas. I’m glad you could join us. Your health is completely restored, I trust?”

The insane smile grew an inch or two. “I’m totally hardcore,” he growled, “and I have some things need doing. Who’s coming with me?”

Judas motioned. “Come on, Thomas. Sit with us. Eat.”

The two stared each other down for a moment and Bleakly’s grin subsided a bit.

“Well, okay. Sure, fine. Yeah I’ll take some lobster. Judas, what’s most expensive for you to restock? ‘Cause I”ll have that.”

Jacobson leaned toward Bleakly and muttered something under his breath.

bleakly

Heh. Very few robots make recharging look cute. Look at the way she gnaws gently on that power cord. Almost like she’s eating spaghetti.

 

Judas looked over at me as Jacobson started to ask me, in hushed tones, how I’d healed so quickly. I just shook my head.

I didn’t mind Judas… but just being around him was bringing back… old memories. Frankly my greatest wish at the moment was to regroup in Jacobson’s car and synchronize our electronics. If we can link up Jacobson’s dashboard AI, Hannah’s onboard modem, and my handheld… we might stand a chance against the Neithermen. Wait- did Jacobson just mention the Neith-

Judas cleared his throat loudly. He daintily held a handheld in two fingers, reading its screen at arm’s length. “Well, I am afraid that I must do you all the dishonor of begging your pardon- my business calls. You have all been most excellent guests. I believe you will find everything you could require is at your command if you address one of my robots. Also, I have prepared each of you a gift. These you will find in Jacobson’s automobile. And now, I must take my leave.” And in a puff of flim-flam, he was gone.Dodgy bastard.

jacobson

One of Judas’ men stopped me before we got to the garage level.

“Mister Jacobson. There is something you must know.” He was a very tall, well-dressed man- someone new. No one I recognized. He wore sunglasses: he was part of Judas’ security detail.

I nodded. “Yes, go on.”

“Bleakly has brought something terrible here. You have heard of the Neithermen?”

I grimaced. “I’ve heard enough. They followed us here?”

“And they will try to follow you after you leave. Judas has taken measures to assure your safety, but even Judas’ efforts will not protect you entirely.”

“Is Judas in any kind of danger?”

The man shook his head. “No. But they know we have assisted you. Plan your next moves accordingly.”

I thanked him and caught up with the others.

Just what I needed…

————————–

“Pens? He gave us novelty pens?”

I couldn’t believe it. The dude was loaded and his idea of a gift worthy of mention was- pens. Jacobson barely looked at his, instead pocketing it and concentrating on driving.

Bleakly sat in the back, inspecting his pen closely. “Be thankful, ye. Pens can be useful for who knows all manner of things. They’re invaluable for a field tracheotomy, it could be an impromptu weapon, you can use it to start a fire, not to mention taking notes, opening packages, temporary tattoos…”

Jacobson glanced over at me with an expression of mild amusement. “Judas hasn’t known you all that long, my dear. And the pen, as they say, is mightier than the sword.”

Bleakly hadn’t stopped enumerating pen uses. “…you can use it to make calculations, keep a door wedged open, poke around circuitry so you don’t shock yourself, type on a keyboard without leaving fingerprints…”

I shrugged at Jacobson. “I dunno… I was just hoping he’d give us something, you know, useful to help find my father.”

Jacobson gave me a reassuring pat. “We’ll find him, my girl.” He looked at the rear-view mirror. “Where to, Thomas?”

Bleakly paused and told him the address of the Nocter building.

I scribbled on a napkin for a moment or two, but the pens were utter shit, at least for writing with. They were pretty enough, I guess. Had our names printed on them. But I had no clue why Judas thought they would be an appropriate parting gift. He was so nice. Now suddenly he’s this tacky? Fucking weird. Bleakly’s fucking friends.“…or if you need to extend your reach, just by a few inches… if you need to stab out someone’s eyes… if you need to dig a shallow hole… if you want something to chew on other than your fingernails…”

bleakly　

I’m not sure, but I think Judas used to stock his garage with live bats. The place was as dingy as any part of the city, but it seemed to literally carry bad vibrations and a sense of foreboding. I knew that was just part of his security system – he had mnemonorays designed to make sure people come reluctantly and leave fast. You’d think the bastard would have the common decency to turn that shit off while we’re in here, though.In the next ten seconds, any resentment or distrust I felt toward Judas dried up entirely: The second we slipped into Jacobson’s car I knew Judas had really come through for us.

He’d given us pens.

The thing to understand about Judas’ writing instruments is that they weren’t ever just writing instruments. Miss Smith discovered hers’ particular virtues first; it contained monitoring circuitry synchronized to her neural waveplate – essentially she could use it to see around corners, or leave it in a room to listen in on a conversation. She had extendable senses. It was an expensive and lovely piece of technology.

“Now THAT will come in useful, my lovely Miss Smith. Judas is many things. Rich and brilliant are two of the things that he is.”

I toyed with mine for a few moments before I found an interface strip on the side of it.

Awww… you shouldn’t have.

 

The pen fit perfectly to the side of my handheld. The second the interface completed, the handheld screen lit up-

Judas, you are the fucking best.

No matter where I was, as long as they had their pens, I could tell if Jacobson was alive or in danger and if Hannah was online or damaged.

　

 I smirked. “What’d you get, Jake?”

Jacobson was silent. He muttered something under his breath about swords then told his dashboard AI to play something dark by Beethoven. The little AI complied and dark swirls of the ancient symphony twisted around us.

“C’mon, Jake. What’s up?”

“Nothing.”

I patted his shoulder. “All right, all right. Mind if I smoke?”

He shook his head slowly.

“Okay. We’re gonna go hit the Nocter building. I tried the front entrance last time. This time we’re going in the back way… and they’ve got no idea we’re coming.”

I looked at Hannah. “I’m afraid I can’t take the risk of letting you hear anything anyone from Nocter has to say… I don’t know what they did or how Smith modified you, but there’s a risk that you have some kind of backup program installed. There’s a risk that if you hear the wrong thing… you’ll burn out. Entirely.”

She looked at me with nothing but scorn. “My father has gone missing, Mister Bleakly. I have technology and resources that can help him, Mister Bleakly. And you will not fucking tell me what I can not do to help find my father. Are we clear?”

My face was inches from hers. Her eyes were slits; she was a portrait of beauty and wrath. Dames with their goddamned self-righteous-“All right, Miss Smith. If you insist.” I chuckled weakly. “But if you die, I’ll never forgive you.”

“You’ll plug me right back in is what you’d damn well better do. I’m still covered by warranty. Give me one of those cigarettes.”

Beethoven crescendoed, dipping and weaving like a drunken and deadly butterfly. And the car slid through the night.

Okay, Tkachyov. Or whatever your name was. It’s time for us to figure out what the hell you’re up to. I lit another cigarette and started preparing some anti-security scripts on my handheld.

You ready, assholes?

 

hannah

I almost fell asleep for the first hour of the ride, but Bleakly kept thinking of new uses for his pen, exclaiming loudly every time he thought of one he thought was particularly clever.

Jacobson pulled the car into a driveway. I looked around, but we were definitely nowhere near downtown.

“Where are we?” I asked. Wherever we were, it was a ways out of town. There were no signs of life outside the car, just dead plant life. The only man-made thing in sight was an unsightly brown shed.

“I’ll be back, dear. You two keep each other company. I just have to run an errand.” He gave Bleakly a look that would bruise a dinosaur then stepped out of the car, locking the door behind him.

The private eye in the back seat muttered something under his breath.

“What? I didn’t catch that.”

He looked over at me and smiled for an instant, then looked out the window and started violently twiddling his thumbs.

We sat in silence for a few minutes.

Can’t take it anymore. “So… what got you into detectiving?”

He looked over at me, surprised. “Who? What? Me? Oh, heh. Yes, well. It’s actually a funny story. A really funny story that in retrospect is sort of sad really…”

I nodded.

“See, back in high school- ah, no, it was actually in my first year of college- wait, did I go to college? Well, for the sake of the story.

“It was my first year of college and through some fluke and by means of evil trickery I managed to secure the lead singer of the cheerleading squad as my girlfriend. I vigorously ignored her for a couple months, then stole some chocolates for her. A weekend, a party, a few drinks and our relationship was secured for, well, the weekend.

“This was, of course, nowhere near enough time. I needed time enough that she could not deny that our relationship had ever happened, that I could show her off to everyone on campus who had eyes, and so that I could maintain physical contact for as long as humanly possible. This was, if I remember correctly, the entire goal of my adolescent life.

“The problem, as I saw it, was that at any time she could decide to end our relationship. So I set out to prevent this from ever happening, or at least until such a juncture as I saw it as necessary or found a more attractive woman.

“So, I slicked my hair back, put in some color contacts, and created an elaborate tattoo on my neck out of permanent marker. Then I obtained some electronic parts from my Philosophy teacher’s desktop printer and wired them together convincingly. I was ready to make my move.

“The next day I met her after one of her classes and told her I needed her help. I told her that I had traveled in time from the future on a mission from the government and needed to perform a number of missions. First and foremost I needed to make sure that my presence did not cause her to change any critical actions she’d take while I was time traveling to the past, so I revealed to her the timeline of events for the coming week. This timeline, of course, did not involve her breaking up with me.”

Jesus Christ.

“Oh, sure, she took some convincing. I gave my friend Garry my phone and had him call her phone and impersonate my voice. I’d filled in Garry on some key private facts about our personal life, so that my girlfriend would not be able to come to any conclusion other than the one I wanted her to.

“From then on, every week, I’d meet up with her as my future self, she’d come at midnight and take a careful circuitous route to make sure no one followed her- which gave me enough time to set up my time travel get-up. And every week I’d outline what we’d do that week, emphasizing that if we didn’t adhere precisely to the schedule, we could change the course of history and cause the universe to implode. Good times.

“Four months later I decided she was getting a little too attached to me, so my future self informed her that that was the month we broke up. Gotta do it, space-time and all. Gotta go fight in a future war, if I survive I’ll be back and bring you with me to the future. My future self presumably died in battle about fifty-seven years from the present day.”

“Wow. Uh, wow. Shit.”

He leaned back. “Yeah, I know. It was a pretty rotten thing to do, but to this day I’m still proud of it.”

“Okay, so how does that have ANYTHING to do with you deciding to become a detective?”

“Deciding to become a whatnow?”

The car doors clicked and Jacobson climbed into the car.

He looked somewhat more relaxed than he had earlier- almost relieved.

He said, “Well, I think we’re ready to go. Now, Thomas – where did you say that Nocter building was?”

I ignored Bleakly and listened to Jacobson’s radio for as long as I could. Luckily for me, that was just far enough to get to the Nocter building- an unassuming, five-floor affair downtown.

Jacobson parked the car in a back alley away from the range of the security cameras.

“Thomas,” he said, “how exactly do you propose that we-”

But Bleakly was already gone, skipping away like a schoolgirl and giggling quietly. His hat came off briefly, but he recovered it and kept one hand on his head the rest of the way to the back door of my father’s company.

I turned to Jacobson. “Seriously, what’s with the hat?”

He shook his head. “I’ve asked, my child. I’ve asked. For now we have to hope that whatever it is he thinks he’s doing will actually be useful in locating your father.”

Strange sounds emanated from the back entrance where Bleakly had disappeared. Not one but two men emerged, one with hands held high and a terrified expression on his face, the other- Bleakly, grinning like an idiot but speaking like the unholy love-child of a professional wrestler and Sam Spade.

“YOU DON’T TURN AROUND YOU DON’T OPEN YOUR EYES YOU DON’T SPEAKUNLESS I TELL YOU TO OR YOU WILL BE LESS AN INTESTINE DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?”

The poor guy did not look like he was prepared for this. In fact, he looked more suited to sitting in  his cubicle and sipping coffee. Bleakly forced him against the wall, where I saw what it was the poor cubiclyte had jammed in his back- two knuckles and a pen. Bleakly mimed laughing, pointing at the makeshift “gun.”

“NOW YOU LISTEN CLOSELY THIS WILL BE THE ONLY THING YOU SAY AND IF YOU SAY ANYTHING DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT BE GOING HOME TODAY- WHAT IS THE SECURITY CODE TO GET IN THE BACK DOOR OF THIS LOCAL FIRM OWNED BY NOCTER PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED?”

The guy was choking and crying but spat out the answer instantly. “Six eight two ohmygod it’s six eight two lemme go ohh no no no..”

“Hey, great! Thanks, you’ve been great. Don’t call the cops or I’ll cut off your nuts. I might cut ‘em off anyway. Get the fuck out of here, I know where you live.” Bleakly waved him away. The crying man sprinted off.

——————
bleakly
“Six eight two… goddamnit, just let me go. It’s six eight two.”

The guy was just about begging for mercy, but against these guys, mercy was not something I could afford. I slammed his head against the bricks and he went limp. I performed the action a couple more times to make sure he wasn’t feigning unconsciousness and considered breaking his neck. These ARE the guys that installed this collar BENEATH my skin. Speakin’ a which I feel just fine. Although maybe that has something to do with the- ahhh shit.

My head was swimming, but I cast the thought of breaking the man’s neck out of my mind and everything came back into focus. Okay, I’ve fought off the damn collar’s influence enough to hurt ‘em. Just not enough to kill ‘em.

Jacobson helped me put the guy in his trunk.

Inside the front door I noted four or five security cameras at least. I looked at Smith then pointed up at the cameras. She nodded and closed her eyes. With any luck, between her on-board modem and my handheld- a ha!

The cameras spat sparks. Whoever was watching would see a few seconds of empty footage looping over and over. We were effectively invisible.

Jacobson motioned to me and pointed to a door marked “Stairwell.” Good idea, especially considering how well elevators worked for me last time.

We got into the stairwell and Miss Smith shook her head. “No bugs or cameras in the stairwells. We’re good ’till we get out onto a floor.” She started to scout ahead.

Jacobson grabbed my shoulder. “Thomas. Judas’ pen… it wasn’t a gadget.”

“Huh? If he didn’t give you a gadget then-”

He wordlessly pulled the slender black cylinder out of his coat and pointed to a very small symbol toward the tip of the pen. It was a Learning Coil.

It was… beautiful. Ugly. Deadly. Illegal as hell. It could contain anything. It could be useful to us… or it could fry Jacobson’s brain.

“Greg. Don’t use it-”

“You think I’m stupid?”

“-No, just…  it could contain anything. You know why those are illegal, and-”

“But Judas gave me this one. I had it checked out by the one guy I know who’d do it, and he says it works. It’s good for two, maybe three more uses.”

“Just hold off, okay? Don’t use it unless… unless we don’t have any other options.”

He nodded gravely. “My thoughts precisely, my boy.”

Hannah descended to us. “It looks like this stairwell only goes up to the eighth floor. We’ll have to find another way up to the top floor from there.”

Jacobson thanked her and we started climbing.

The Learning Coil could tip everything in our favor, or it could kill Jacobson… or worse. It was a bundle of knowledge- not just book-knowledge, but knowledge of actions. One click to the temple and all that beautiful dangerous Mindscan tech could give Jacobson kung-fu, or an innate understanding of physics. It could make him superhuman.

Or it could rob him of the ability to walk. Or talk. Or breathe.

Damn you, Judas.

We reached the eighth floor.

hannah

I wasn’t sure how to feel. On the one hand, we were breaking and entering. On the other hand, all this was in my father’s name- wasn’t it worth anything to find him or at least find out what happened to him? On the other hand once again, Bleakly and Jacobson were not exactly acting… professional. Jacobson was between us and he was pretty far ahead, so I can’t be sure, but as we climbed up the stairwell to the fourth floor, I’m pretty sure Bleakly was humming Mission Impossible.
 
 
“Hannah, watch our backs. One second. Jake, come check this out.”
Jacobson stepped up to the door Bleakly had cracked open and they spoke in hushed tones.
It was still pretty quiet- it almost felt like we were sneaking around an ordinary office building for nothing.
Jacobson waved me up the stairs, but as soon as I got through the stairwell door, Bleakly was already dragging us into some closet. He closed the door behind us and flicked the light switch.
The entire room was filled with very, very expensive and important-looking computer equipment.
“Ah, yes yes yes- this, you see this, this is the part where you find the intestines of the evil corporation all unguarded… ah ha ha ha, yes. Yes, yes.” As he spoke he began unplugging things at random, pushing any red button, unscrewing what he could and occasionally smashing something with a lock on it.
I looked over to Jacobson, who shrugged. “It’ll definitely be a good distraction as we try to get upstairs. Their IT guys will be all over the place… and then their Security guys…”
Bleakly stopped giggling and unplugging things; he appeared to be listening intently to something.
“Okay,” he said, “Jacobson, c’mere. I wanna see something-” and they were gone.
You let this guy inside an office building for a few minutes and already he’s… I don’t want to know what he’s done. I hope to God this helps us find my dad. This has got to be SO fucking illegal…
 
 
Bleakly screamed something and started cackling like a madman.
Jacobson burst through the door and grabbed my hand. “RUN!”

jacobson

We approached the ninth floor landing not a second too soon. Climbing stairwells is not the sort of sleuthing I signed up for when I was a young man. Unfortunately, I was no longer a young man and the steps were beginning to take their toll.
Bleakly had taken the lead, of course. He was humming to himself, but I could tell he was anxious. He motioned to me and I struggled to catch up.
“Yes, my boy?”
“Stay here for one sec, Jake- just gotta-” he slid through the partially-opened door. I caught the door as it closed and glanced out, but he was back almost immediately. “Okay, I picked it. C’mon. C’mere. Hannah, you too.”
We shuffled into the closet and I looked around in the dim light. We appeared to have stumbled into some sort of server cabinet- the closet was all computers and wires.
I turned to Smith. “Hannah, you know how to use this sort of thing, right? You’re good with computers?”
She nodded. “My dad taught me how to write programs and some other stuff…”
Thomas rubbed his hands. “C’mon, make with the hacking. Clear us a path. Need to get to the top floor. Move.”
She gave him a look but sat wordlessly to tap at a terminal. Her eyes creased in increasing determination for a few moments, then-
“Got it. I’ve backed up some of their encrypted files so we can look at them later, and I just brought down every computer in the building.”
I looked at her, mouth agape. “That… I don’t know if that was reasonable or advisable, but that was very, very impressive, my girl.”
She looked pleased with herself. “Aw, it wasn’t-”
“Okay we’ve got to move now. Jake, help me scout.”
As soon as we stepped out of the closet, I took hold of Thomas’ arm. “Thomas, there’s something I need to tell you.”
He folded his hands and looked at me impatiently. “Hm? Yes? What?”
I pulled out the pen Judas had given me.
“Look at the pen, my boy. Look at that symbol. Judas’ pen isn’t just a pen.”
Realization dawned on his face. “Is… is that-”
“Yes, I’m afraid so. It’s the signature of Judas’ old armorer. Remember? Judas, Pilate, and-”
“The Pharisees. I remember.”
“Yes, the Pharisees. Makers of fine weaponry since sixteen-thirty-two. Judas gave me a gun, Thomas. A very incredible gun.”
“What’sitdowhat’sitdowhat’sitdo?”
I grimaced. “I hate carrying the thing, but here. Look.” I pushed the button at the pen’s blunt end and the thing melted in my hand. It remained the same weight, but its shape was changed entirely- it was an Omnigun.
Bleakly whistled. “Takes any kind of ammo, gets through any security checkpoint, doesn’t show up on X-Ray or scanners or…”
“Or anything. I am now in possession of a very, very deadly killing machine. And I am not happy about it.” I flicked the safety and the gun was a pen.
Thomas nodded. “Okay. Cool. Well. Hope you don’t have to shoot anybody.”
I shook my head. “I won’t. I won’t do it. But… I’m glad it wasn’t something worse.”
“Ah, well. C’mon, grab Hannah. Let’s- oh, shit.”
I looked in the direction of his gaze. The elevators apparently still functioned properly- and they were ejecting several pale, identical men in suits.
bleakly

I shook my head and squinted through the door. “I see three or four cameras just from here. If we could divert security elsewhere in the building-” I looked over at Hannah. She nodded. “-then I can just use my handheld and, bingo.”
I looked down at my handheld. Lifesigns.1_z was functioning perfectly- it looked like old man Jacobson wasn’t used to climbing stairs, judging by his heartbeat. Sorry, pops.
Hannah closed her eyes for a few seconds. “Okay, I’m in.” She opened her eyes and smiled. “Guess they weren’t expecting a third-gen ‘droid to get this far…”
“Yeah, but you gotta reason, sweetheart.” You got somethin’ to fight for…
I squinted through the doorway. All clear. “C’mon, kids. Let’s- oh, shit.”
The elevator opened. Neithermen. Of course.
I grabbed Jacobson. “Listen. I can’t talk to them. I can’t speak to them, I suggest you don’t either. Get Hannah the hell out of here and don’t use it!”
He nodded and they disappeared into the stairwell.
Alright. Let’s do this.
They were already halfway across the office. It’s funny, but I’ve never had this much time to look at ‘em before. Said the man as he ran like hell.
“I AM TALKING TO MYSELF RIGHT NOW!” I started laughing as loud as I could. Not talking directly to them. I’m talking to myself. My clever, sexy self. Okay okay okay distractions, distractions, what can I use-
A red box on the wall caught my eye. Fire alarm. Perfect.
A flame-retardant artificial rain showered down on the office workers and scientists. On the other side of the floor, the Neithermen started running toward me. Time to go time to go go GO-
I sprinted to the end of a line of cubicles- only to be confronted directly by one of them.
A single second stretched like an eternity. He was dressed up like one of the FBI guys from the old days, hat, sunglasses, coat and all. Something weird about the ears, though. They looked almost blue.
The man’s face – if he was a man – was… not expressionless. As a matter of fact, those pasty-white features seemed almost embarrassed.
In slow motion he reached into his coat. “Don’t try to-”
That was all I needed to hear. Hell, if I talk to these guys, I’ll pass out. So go go GO.
I vaulted over the cubicle wall and shoved a dronebot out of the way.
If my handheld’s memory served me properly, the stairwell to the tenth floor was at the opposite corner of the building- Oh God handheld do not fail me now…
My peripheral vision calmly mentioned that there were men in suits slipping and sliding toward me. They don’t like water. Gotta remember that. Useful.
I sprinted to the northwest stairwell and slammed the door shut behind me. C’mon handheld do me a favor here there’s gotta be a door-sealing protocol YES!
The door sealed as the radio signal from my handheld resonated with a quiet thrum. One second later the door emitted a loud thump- it seemed they were not far behind.And it won’t take ‘em long to override that door.
Just gotta keep moving. Just a couple more stories and I’ll be there. The top floor. The place where I can solve the case.
It was a fairly ugly stairwell, as stairwells go. The colors were all wrong, and as for atmosphere, it was almost dank, an adjective usually reserved for dungeons and poorly-tended cellars. It gave me the oddest feeling that I was going in the wrong direction, as if rather than ascending I were somehow being lowered into the earth.
Gotta shake that stuff. It’s just their tech messing with your head.
I heard the door give a couple landings down and I started shouting again to distract the Neithermen and perhaps give them the impression I was speaking to them and thus might be free of the collar entirely. If they think that, they might think I’m capable of killing. Any edge in a storm…
“HA, HA! I AM AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE! I’M OPENING THE DOOR! I HAVE REACHED MY DESTINATION, AND I AM STILL TALKING TO MYSELF IN LOUD TONES! HA!”
“Yes, you are.” I said.
Wait, no I didn’t. That wasn’t me. Well, it was. But that’s fucking impossible.
He- it was like looking into a mirror. It was a mirror, but it didn’t move in sync with me. It wasn’t a mirror. It was real.
“Hello, Thomas. I’m Thomas.”
——————-
jacobson
We weren’t two flights down the stairs when the lights flickered and alarms began braying their bitonal ballad.
Hannah was startled at the sound.”What the hell?”
“Thomas must have set off the fire alarm to add to the confusion. Clever, mad child…”
Random employees and scientists filed into the stairwell. In moments we were anonymous faces, lost in the crowd.
I spoke to Hannah in low tones. “We’ll follow everyone else to the ground floor and bring the car around back. If Thomas hasn’t returned in ten more minutes, I’m going back for him.”
“And so am I.” She looked defiantly at me- much more defiantly than I had come to expect from her. The gleam in her eye was evidence enough- there was no way I was going to change her mind, especially not while surrounded by the flunkies of the organization that had robbed her of her only family.
I nodded and gave her hand a firm squeeze.

The first thing Jacobson did when we got back to the car was immediately start phoning Bleakly.
“Pick up, come on my boy, pick up…”
He pulled the car into a side alley – just out of view of the Nocter employees who were apparently still milling around trying to figure out why the fire alarm had been pulled.
Poor fucks. Wonder how long it’ll take the fire department to show up?
I looked over at Jacobson. He looked really worried- odd, because this whole thing seemed almost comically over-exaggerated, I mean, if my father hadn’t gone missing…
Something small struck the windshield. Lots of small somethings.
I covered my mouth. “Oh my God. Is- is that glass?”
Jacobson was already out of the car craning his head upward.
I looked over just in time to see a dark shape fall from a second-story window and into a conveniently-placed dumpster.
Oh my God, is that a person, is that- fucking damn it.
I scrambled out of the car.
Jacobson was already at the dumpster reaching in.
Bleakly popped up and out. A grim look was smeared on his face along with something unidentifiable and brown, but for whatever reason, when he spoke he had a glibly cheerful tone in his voice.
“Ah, I’m alive. Excellent. Now all we’ve got to do is get the hell out of here, ditch the car, and sneak into City Hall.”
bleakly 

He was definitely shorter than me. But other than that-
“Oh God.” I said. (The real me, that is.)
“Congratulations. You’re obsolete.”
When… when I was out. When I was here before, unconscious… I heard a familiar voice speak. A voice I knew… like… like my own. They said… I wasn’t needed anymore.
 
He was standing at the far end of a long conference table, in front of a giant window that had to have the best view of the worst city on Earth.
“Who are you and what the fuck are you doing here?”
“You’re a detective. Figure it out.”
I bared my teeth. “Who made you?”
“What do you mean?”
“You didn’t propel yourself into existence with cleverness and flatulence.”
“No, that would be you.”
I grabbed a chair and threw it aside. I was a pillar of rage- at that moment I could have decapitated him with my bare hands. But even more than with rage I was filled with something darker and quieter. I had to know what the hell he was.
“I know you’re a goddamn robot. But somebody made you look like me, talk like me. That’s what they meant when they said they wouldn’t need me- nobody’d be able to tell the difference and you’d be able to get Smith’s robot. But you didn’t do that. You can’t, yet.”
It laughed, a disturbing, slightly staticky take on my own laugh- a terrible disorienting dissonance.
I gritted my teeth. “But nobody wants replica ‘bots. Nobody with the cash to buy them wants that to happen for fear it’ll happen to them. The technology was abandoned along with Mindscan tech. So whoever’s doing this has got to be radical. And rich.”
Its face twisted into a scowl- not my own, warm, familiar grimace but a sickening approximation. “Clever, clever. Now figure out who’s commissioning it without outside information and escape from this room. You’re fucked.”
The door behind me reverberated throatily, then whispered the cries of the men behind it.
“It seems like I’m running out of options.”
He- it- raised its eyebrows. “Quite correct. It won’t take the Neithermen a minute to get through the encryption you’ve dropped into the lock on that door, and then your options are surrender and continue to be useful to us, or allow me to take your place. Should you harm me in any way, your little dog-collar will immediately subdue you. You’d be dead as soon as the Neithermen got into the room. It seems you have very few real options, my friend.”
And, worse, I’ve used up my entire bag of anti-robot tricks. Hell, even the old kill signal program used to run through my collar, and that ain’t mine no more…
 
 
It was a pretty big room. There were easily fifteen or sixteen feet between us, and he was standing right in front of that huge window, one huge piece of crystal, a ridiculous expense…
 ”Cornelius City,” I said suddenly.
Robo-me looked dumbfounded- a strange expression on a robot, and even stranger on my face. “How could you have possibly-”
“Cornelius City is the only man alive with the wealth to have a private robot personalization and manufacturing plant. Just a guess. Thanks for confirming it.”
I turned and rubbed my face with my left hand. My right hand immediately went to my outside coat pocket, just out of the robot’s sight.”There’s a funny thing, Tom.” Come on, it’s gotta be in there.
His eyes flashed red with synthetic malice. “Oh?”
There it is.
My fingers located a little round capsule, still intact… Timing’s gonna be tough- “I don’t need all of you to figure out what I do next and prove that Cornelius City is involved. I just need a piece of you.” Any chip out of him’ll be enough…
I popped the tab of Thann.
Robo-me screamed, as comprehension filled its crimson eyes. “EIGHT EIGHT NOBIS PACEM!“
His words sent a ripple through my head- but just a ripple. Adrenaline had already flooded my bloodstream. Sweat leapt out of every pore on my body.
“Funny thing is, when I knowingly take sedatives, this collar you got on me does… some… funny… shit…”
The collar was trying to put me out, hard. The Thann wanted to help, but most of all, a separate sequence in that collar wanted to fight the Thann.
Every nerve in my body was telling me that I was on fire.
“Hey, Robo-me.” I started laughing. “Turns out I don’t fall asleep so easy when I’m on fire. Oh, thanks… tellin’ me the… code, phrase, thing that knocks out.” Now I can try to build a resistance to- oh who am I kidding, screw coherent thought.
I was a quarterback and my buddies Hector, Steve, and Bonnie were blockers. I pulled out my revolver and went long.
Four shots hit the robot. Four at least. They were armor-piercing rounds, not a lot of stopping power but they’d cut right through metal, through metal and through crystal-hope that scores the crystal enough-
Even with the collar’s reaction to the sedative it was getting very difficult to stand, much less sprint. But I did it anyway, every fiber of me, every muscle pointed straight at my still-standing double. My shoulder made contact first- I pushed off with my other leg, we were sailing through space, we had one more step to go before we’d hit that window-Please let it break, don’t let me be here when the Neithermen come…
I held as tightly as I could, a deadly bear-hug, I had to hope he’d cushion my fall- my thirteen-story fall…
My entire universe was my right leg. My right leg was on fire, it held, somehow it held, I used every remaining ounce of energy and extended it against the floor, we were slamming into crystal and we were surrounded by jagged bloody snowflakes and the wind whistled around and the robot made buzzing noises and I hoped that I would not break too many bones especially my spine and then I thought nothing at all and it was quiet and nice
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and then
　　
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hannah said something
　
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I was being lifted and Jacobson shouted and I managed to say something about needing a chip and Jacobson said not to talk and then everything was dark and quiet
jacobson

It was a quiet drive home; neither Thomas nor Hannah seemed to be in the mood to chat. Hannah just brooded. Thomas clicked away incessantly on that handheld of his, occasionally stopping to squeeze his temples for a few seconds, but never breaking the silence.
It was a solid half hour before we were out of downtown and I was confident we weren’t being followed. Thomas still hadn’t eased up on the handheld so I figured it’d be as good a time as any to bother him.
“So, Thom-”
“Shut up.” He continued to tap at the handheld. I looked at him in the rear-view, but all I could see was the top of his hat.
I turned and looked at Hannah. She shook her head and resumed staring out her window.
I cleared my throat and tried again. “We need someplace to go. So, where to, Boss?”
Bleakly went for the temples again for a moment then snapped, “Just take us back to my office, alright? I need quiet. Nobody’s following us and they won’t look for me there. Now please, please, please? Shut. Up.”
“Fine. Fine, fine.” I punched the coordinates into my dashboard and set the car to autopilot.
———–
hannah

The last time I’d seen Bleakly’s office, his desk had been littered with notecards and the place had smelled like industrial-strength cleaning solution.
The smell was stronger (how he managed it I’ll never guess) and the floor was littered with notecards. Now, when I say ‘littered,’ I mean wall to wall and arranged in a perfect grid with no more than a few centimeters between each card.
As soon as he opened the door he strode carelessly to his desk, sending cards left and right.
I gingerly tiptoed into a corner before he stopped me with an exclamation.
“Stop.”
I looked down at the ground- the cards beneath my feet were blank. “These cards are-”
“Yep, they’re blank. They signify leads I haven’t looked at yet, and- screw it, I’ve got a system, but I’m damned if I’ve got time to explain it to you right now. Just feel free to walk on the ones that have something written on them.”
Jacobson had already found a box to sit on and looked content to wait until Bleakly was ready to talk, and good for him. Patience is a virtue. Too bad for me. My patience had all but run out.
I put two hands on his desk and started tapping. He didn’t look up.
I said, “Where’s my dad?”
He held up one finger and continued typing with the others.
I did not break his finger, but that is only because I was able to keep myself from trying too hard, because I probably can not break a finger one-handed, and because he appeared to be double-jointed.
“Where’s my dad, asshole?“
He finally made eye contact with me. “I’ve got good news for you and bad news for you.”
“What? Anything? You’ve actually-”
With his free hand he pointed to his violently restrained finger. I released it and he held it up once again.
“Miss Smith I have good news for you and bad news. I can give these to you in their current form or I can continue my research and give you a more satisfying explanation. If you wish for me to explain it to you now there will be a surcharge of-”
“Fuck you. Tell me what you know.”
He took off his hat and ran his hands through his hair. “All right. Okay. Here’s how it is, lovely Miss Smith. There’s good news, and there’s bad news.
“The good news is, your father is not dead.”
My knees gave, my heart leapt, and tears swam in my eyes. If I’d been able to speak I would have said something like “Oh- Oh, thank-”
“The bad news is, your father is not alive.”
I do not recall how I crossed the desk or how the lapels of his coat came to be in my hands or how Jacobson came to be behind me, but I do recall screaming “What inLIVING FUCK do you mean?”
With an altogether-too-smug look on his face Bleakly once a gain proffered the despised finger. “Okay, look. He’s not alive- not legally. His death certificate is on file with Nocter Pharmaceuticals. It has to be, because that’s the only legal way that they can cryogenically freeze human beings. Now, wait. Waiiit. Wait. Don’t kill me. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Look. Okay, look.”
He offered the little screen. It showed a few small numbers and a squiggly line.
He pointed. “These are your father’s life signs. This information is not publicly available and without certain network keys and other information I gained before and during my altercations at your father’s employer I would not be able to access them, and even now I am having some trouble. But I do know that your father is alive-slightly. He is currently cryogenically frozen.”
“Cryogenically frozen?”
Bleakly shrugged and tapped a few more buttons. “It doesn’t say so explicitly, but we know Nocter’s been investing in lots of weird equipment and, most tellingly, cryoprotectant. And if your father’s heart is really beating once every minute, either he’s magic, not human, or cryogenically suspended.”
I shook my head. “No. Nobody- why-”
“It looks like they’ve managed to do what nobody else has- freeze people and bring ‘em back whole. At least, let’s hope- I mean, I’m sure they’ve got it. Nothing to worry about.”
I couldn’t believe it. “Why would they do something like that?”
He pursed his lips. “I’m not sure. In fact I really have no idea. All I know is they don’t want us to know and they froze your father. So if you’ll excuuuse me-”
I sat down heavily. It was so much – my father was alive! But- frozen? Why? What is wrong with Nocter?
Jacobson piped up, “So, where is he?”
———–
jacobson

“So, where is he?” I asked.
Thomas grimaced at me. “That’s the tough part. Remember I said we had to hit City Hall to see old man City?”
I nodded.
“He’s gotta be on something City owns, something big and well-guarded. Lucky for me, this chip I got from the Nocter building’s got access to most of City’s stuff- but only for now and I really need to stay focused in case he locks me out of the system. If I can find Smith’s exact location we stand a better chance of getting him back. Easily, I mean. Nothing to worry about. Just another couple of…” He was lost in the data once more. He didn’t notice Hannah, face in her hands, shoulders shaking.
I put my coat around her and whispered what comfort I could to her. Poor Thomas was worlds away- simultaneously doing as much as he could for Hannah while at the same time ignoring her immediate need for soothing human contact.
“Right, well. We’ll be back, Thomas. We’re just going to get some coffee.”
He waved.
With a sigh, I opened the door for Hannah and cast a backwards glance at the detective wrapped up in his case.
 
 
God help you, Thomas. God help us all… 
bleakly

With Jacobson and Smith gone I could finally get down to business.
I hadn’t been too clear the first few minutes after the dumpster, but apparently I’d let Jacobson know what I needed; he’d retrieved most of an electric eyeball from robo-me’s still-twitching frame.
I still needed the opportunity to explain to Jacobson why there’d been a broken robotic duplicate of myself in my arms when I terminated my thirteen-story fall by slamming into that dumpster; luckily, he hadn’t brought it up in front of Hannah. I make it a policy of not being asked questions I don’t know the answer to; when I refuse to answer a question, I prefer it be out of genuine spite and mystery rather than an inability to do so.
It looked like Cornelius’s robot was a later model, snazzy, slick, and other s-words too. Most importantly, the thing had layered information storage.
Layered information storage was a pretty new technology at the time… and the best thing about new technologies is, they’re full of holes nobody knows about yet… well, almost nobody. I just so happened to know a few tricks regarding lay-info-sto.

Still got it. Owe ya one, Jake.
A little handheld magic and I could pull the last few thoughts my robotic double had. And with a little luck-
Aha!
A fragmented video started playing.
The video was from my double’s perspective. He appeared to be having a conversation on a handheld, very fast, and in very low tones.
His left hand enclosed his handheld. His right hand was tapping impatiently on the desk in front of him.
I looked away from my handheld at my right hand- which, involuntarily, had been tapping impatiently. Well, that’s fuckin’ creepy…
I looked back at the video.
“Yes sir. I understand, but- sir, we *** — … on him.”
Parts of the file were corrupted- nothing I could do about that, unfortunately.
“Now. Not to mention that fact that ***—… she knows about- yes sir. I understand. But may I ***—… the event anything should happen to me, we dispa***—…ithermen to apprehend her immediately. I***”
Oh no. Oh no dammit-
 
I flicked the video aside and brought up-

Since the door offered only social acceptability when what I needed was celerity, I took the window out of my office.
It was a window-exit sort of day.

hannah

I smiled at her over my coffee. “Just be patient with him, Hannah. He really is making major progress. The information he’s getting from the disks he stole just may lead us directly to your father’s location! I admit it’s a strange sort of case, but there you have it. There is not one other detective on the face of the earth who I’d trust with this case over Thomas.”
She seemed to be getting a hold of herself. “I know. It’s just… it’s been insane. What was he thinking jumping eight stories? He could have been killed, and I don’t know, the shooting, and it’s… and I just want to know that my dad is going to be okay. So that he can tell me I’m going to be okay.”
I had to utilize all the fatherly powers contained in my mustache to give her the smile I thought she needed right then. “I’m sure he will be. And I know if he were here right now he’d tell you that you will be, too. Strange things may have happened today, but if I know Thomas… and trust me, if anyone does, I do… yes, if I know Thomas, he would never allow anything to happen to you.”
For the first time since Thomas’ unorthodox landing, Hannah started to smile a little. “Thanks, Gregory. You don’t know how much that mea-” She was interrupted by some inconsiderate fool who drove a nondescript black van through the front wall of the coffee-shop.
A moment later I had gained my bearings to such a degree that I could tune out the screams of the other patrons and recognize the pale, identical men in dark blue suits exiting the van and approaching us with easy, measured strides.
I remained seated and looked up at the nearest one’s face. This one appeared to be bald, with a piercing blue gaze and an unaccountably embarrassed expression- as if I’d just mentioned some faux pas he’d committed in front of a large social gathering.
I sipped my coffee and affected all the ‘cool’ I could. “So, lads, I’ll suppose you’re the boys call yourselves the Neithermen. It’s very nice to finally meet you in person.” Under the table I attempted, desperately, to pull Judas’ pen from my pocket and set it to its ‘omnigun’ configuration. And what shall I use as ammunition? Surely there must be some setting or- Confound it!
One of them moved toward Hannah. With a bellow I launched myself at him- and then all was darkness and silence.
hannah

Jacobson shrugged. “He says strange things sometimes. He’s a strange man. He’s also very, very good at what he does.”

I nodded slowly. “I just get this feeling… it’s silly, I guess. Just, it feels like, that we’re not, you know, on the same page. That he’s really well and truly insane and if I listen to him too closely I’ll wind up believing him.”

Jacobson patted my hand. “It’s all right. I’ve seen stranger things- not many of them, you understand. But trust me. There is no one better suited to discovering your father’s whereabouts and apprehending those responsible than Thomas Bleakly.”


I smiled at him. At moments like that, he almost reminded me of my father. Except with a mustache. My father with a mustache and bugfuck crazy friends.


“Thanks. You don’t know how much that means to me.”


He smiled warmly. “More coffee, dear?”


“Yeah, I’d-”


A melodic beeping interrupted me. I raised my eyebrows as Jacobson, embarrassment unnecessarily commandeering and twitching his mustache, pulled out his charmingly outdated phone. I didn’t recognize the ringtone; he indicated through hand signals that he’d been meaning to change it.


Then the motions and eyerolling stopped. A moment later, his chatty calm had dried up, leaving behind monosyllablic questions and a spreading frown.


“You’re- you’re sure? They’re back. What, were you- no! Of course not! Just… stay calm, all ri- oh. Oh, no. No, no, no-”


I tried to catch his eye, mouthing what’s wrong? What’s happening?


He closed the cell phone and stood without looking at me. “Stay here, Hannah. I’ll be back in a few minutes. If I’m not… here’s my keys. If I’m not back, take the car and drive. Just drive.”

bleakly


Multitasking was never my strong suit, but I make a policy of not having strong suits. Hell, it may just be that simultaneously running, reading and interpreting lifesigns from a handheld electronic device, and screaming “Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit” is simply difficult. Go ahead and try it sometime to maximize your appreciation of this part of the story. It’ll still be here. Just go run a lap while fucking around on a handheld. If possible, be very, very worried about your loved ones, with a growing conviction that something has gone terribly wrong. Then come back. Don’t worry, I’ll bold the next sentence so it’s easy to find when you get back.


Now that you’re back, you’ll know how I felt when I realized it would take me way too long to get where I needed to go on foot. So once again I opted for speed over convenience.


Back alleys in this town tend to be filled with broken junk and broke junkies. On the rare occasions I was in a sane and calm state of mind I did not navigate back alleys in that neighborhood on a whim.


Having assessed the risk I sprinted down the first dripping brick canyon that yielded an entrance to me. C’mon c’mon it’s gonna be okay it’s gonna be okay SHIT. According to Lifesigns.1_z‘s blinking indication on my handheld everything was not going to be okay. Hannah was in panic mode (I thought they disabled those?) and Jacobson’s bloodstream had more adrenaline than red blood cells in it.


I didn’t care that I would be exhausted by the point I got to Sharkness cafe. I didn’t care I’d have nothing left to fight with. I just needed to be there and I needed to be there five minutes ago. My legs complained, I was out of breath. My stupid fucking coat was holding me back like a parachute-


“You’re in a hell’vuh hurry, son.” A voice boomed loud enough to make me trip and skid along in the muck. A synthetically augmented voice: some thug who had his voicebox replaced, laced and bass’d was pointing something buzzing and sharp at my face.


Not. Right. NOW.


Epinephrine does funny things. Ha! Ha! Ha.


After shooting the brainless mass of tubes and meat in each kneecap and thus rendering it an annoyance rather than an obstacle, I made it to the other end of the alleyway, just a short sprint from Sharkness. It was just around the corner-


And I was just close enough to recognize the pale, identical men striding through the smoking remains of Sharkness.

“GREG!”  A familiar voice cut through the haze.


My heart was -ugh- fluttering as I awoke. Age and electricity-based weapons are never a healthy combination. I would count myself lucky I did not suffer a heart attack, except- No!


I inhaled too sharply. “Hannah!” I coughed; my lungs were filled with smoke and ozone and my mouth knew the taste of copper.


“She’s not here. You alright, Greg? Shit, shit. Here. You’ll be all right.” Thomas’ face swam into view. His firm grip seemed the only warm and solid thing at that moment- I felt chills, though I was drenched in sweat.


“My- my word, Thomas, they-”


He was already nodding. “I know. Neithermen. Nothing you could have done. They’ve got Hannah.”


I sat up too quickly. “NO! My word, Thomas, how- I… oh…” My head throbbed with the aftereffects of the diabolical electrical attack.


Thomas’ jaw was set; his lips formed a thin line. “Oh, I’ve got a little surprise that might help us find her. For now, she’s okay. I know she’s okay, and I’m not just saying that.” His eyes flicked to the small screen of his ever-present handheld.


I coughed again. “Thomas, I don’t understand, what are you talking about?”


He pounded my back helpfully. “We’ve got a more pressing matter. Look.”


He handed me a red envelope that bore a large wax seal.


I touched the wax lightly. It was the seal of Cornelius City, iron mogul and the least-liked man ever to have eight separate statues of himself erected within a hundred-mile radius.


Thomas lit a cigarette and helped me to my feet. “That envelope was lying here on the table. It’s addressed to me.”


I tore the envelope open and wordlessly handed him its contents: a notecard with a single handwritten line.


Thomas read it aloud: “You could have just asked. Love, City.”

jacobson

My vision had cleared, and my heart had recovered a steadier rhythm. Thomas remained seated, although his brow remained sharply furrowed and his extremities seemed to positively vibrate with concentration.

The cafe’s other denizens had evacuated long minutes before- it seemed that despite their propensity for violence the Neithermen had not found it necessary to harm uninvolved persons: a whiff of civilization in the midst of the overpowering scent of excrement.
I stood to rummage behind the plaster-covered counter for an unbroken bottle of wine. I returned with two glasses and offered one to Thomas. He shook his head, then looked up and caught my disbelieving expression.
“Gotta headful ‘a landmines right now, Greg. I either gotta be sober or drunk ’nuff not to feel the shrapnel…” He made eye contact briefly then his eyes returned to City’s missive as his voice trailed off.
I set the glass in front of him anyway. “My God, Thomas.”
“Not yours nor anyone else’s thank you much.”
“Be serious, man! For the love of- What now?”
Looking me in the eyes, he set down the letter and all at once became quite still. “We’ve got a number of options, Greg.”
“Oh?”
He nodded. “And the number of options is two.”
My stomach started sinking. “And those are?”
“Life or death, Greg.”

bleakly

I couldn’t stand to see that look in his eyes but hey, whaddayawant.
Even as Jacobson’s face went crimson, his knuckles on the table and wineglass went white. “You’re really going to play it that way? You’re going to abandon a case?”
I took off my hat and put it on the table. “We’ve gone far, Greg. We’ve had good times. Our client Ms. Smith was willing to pay for all expenses of this investigation. We got to play with bad guys, we got to shoot guns. But she’s gone, Greg. And good ol’ Cornelius just gave us a pretty perfumed invitation to join her and step right- into- his- mouth.”
Jacobson cast aside the wineglass; a lesser man would have bellowed. His rage presented itself in the form of his absolutely stony features draining themselves of allexpression, all his anger drawing itself into his twinkling eyes as if he could make his hate tangible and make it stick to me. “A decent man would never- never- abandon a lady in distress.”
Gregory Jacobson was literally my oldest friend. But I said the words anyway. “I never made any sort of claim I was a decent human being.”
Why? Because I’m Thomas Bleakly. Private Eye.
————————-
jacobson

And with that he stood and left the cafe, only tossing back- “Who knows, Greg? You have fun with old man City. Don’t call me.”
What the hell now, Jacobson?
Well, there was really no other solution. I had to continue on my own. As a testament to my honor, my generation’s honor- and, dammit, the human race itself.
I would find her if it killed me.
hannah

What.

The.

HELL.

I started the engine in Jacobson’s car, completely confused what was going on and pissed off in ways I didn’t know I could be.

And then the car shook and there was smoke everywhere

And I started driving, driving

To anywhere. Just away.

Away.

I ran. Away. Like a coward.

I left him. He reminded me of my father. And I left him.

I left him and I went out to the highway driving his car

Oh my god what the fuck why

why

———————————

bleakly

Well, I thought, I am going to change my clothes.

And I’m not gonna wear a hat today.

I know what you’re thinking, and shut the hell up.

Have you shut up yet?

NO, STOP DOING THAT. Don’t. You. Fucking. Judge me.

Because, guess what? I had been tortured, beaten, nearly killed, jumped thirteen goddamn stories, had some kind of psychoclones chasing me and I had done it all without making a penny.

So yeah, fuck you. Seriously. She was a pretty girl, yeah? For a robot, I mean.

But she would keep.

And besides, I consider any case that isn’t profoundly traumatizing in some way an utter failure.

And without creative definitions of success where would we be right now?

That’s right, motherfuckers. Vietnam.

So, I didn’t ever say I was the good guy in this story. I’m just kind of an anarchist. And City? CORNELIUS City? He is a fucking scary man.

Even so, those questions kept popping up in my subconscious. Avoiding your own style. To what end? New identity, new life? Nope, just scaring myself for a little bit to make sure I haven’t changed. There’s a very solid classical philosophical underpinning to all this but I don’t feel like going into it.

You’re bored, I can tell. So let’s talk about when I walked into my office.

I opened the door and my buddy Otto was sitting on the desk.

My buddy Otto was a cop. He was chubby and had a face that told the tale of how goodnatured he really was; he had this really low, mellow monotone, like an old staticky tape that gets offended when you don’t listen. “Hey, Bleak.”

I scowled at him with my darkest scowl. “God DAMMIT- no. It is time for drinking.”

“You and what money?”

I growled at him and put all my remaining energy into a right hook that went through his right cheekbone.

He cleared his throat politely. “First, assaulting an officer of the System is a felony punishable by blah blah blah, and second, I’m a hologram.” He certainly was. He was a top-of-the-bottom-line autocop, mindscanned in who knows how many years back when we actually had public law enforcement.

I was not hung over, but I would have felt much better if I was. “Just shut the hell up and gimme the job.”

jacobson

So he was truly off the case. All right, old bean. Just like old times.
Nuts to Bleakly and his atrophied sense of chivalry. Nuts to City and his draconian schemes. Old-fashioned sleuthing would win the day.
Right, I said to myself, in the old tradition, it is time to cover the hows, wheres, wherefores.
The old safehouse was more than adequate as a base of operations. The truck I kept there had a full tank and was totally “clean” in the Private Eye’s (or criminal) sense- paid off, entered in the computer registries under a legally bulletproof alias, and invisible so long as I didn’t draw attention.
I reviewed the tools at my disposal: The omnigun, loaded for now with old revolver rounds; my own emergency kit, which contained simple first aid along with holoculars, an electric lockpick, and a few simple (but effective) bits of disguise; and my own finely honed senses- not on par with Thomas’ preternaturally attuned abilities, unfortunately, but I’d take chivalry over competent cowardice any day.
I laid the groundwork for my movements carefully. I acquired a hotel room, to be my ostensible location- I wouldn’t sleep there, but I’d perform less secure bits of the trade there, to confuse and draw attention away from my safehouse. Once there I used the hotel’s services to acquire tickets to a few live shows; I’d undoubtedly be shadowed the moment I drew any sort of attention to myself, and I knew the old theaters downtown well enough to slip unnoticed out an unmarked exit during an intermission.
The first such show was an atypically impressive rendition of Hamlet. I regretted wasting the opportunity to behold the young troupe finally put their talents to theatrically wholesome use, but the life of a private investigator is necessarily filled with sacrifices and disappointments.
I hadn’t noticed anyone following me to the  theater, but I hadn’t the slightest doubt that I was well within range of one of City’s sort of goons. In the crowd, he could probably have tapped my shoulder without my recognizing him- but, though my mundane senses noncommitally admitted total failure in registering any sort of conspiracy, my higher perceptions and gut feelings agreed totally with my intellect’s deduction. My next actions would be critical, and would give me some small freedom of movement to begin my plot to decipher City’s motives and discover the whereabouts of poor Miss Smith and her father.

Otto withered under my gaze and raised his hands in surrender. “All right, all right. Here’s the poop.”
I lit a cigarette, put my feet up on my desk (and through Otto’s midsection), and blew smoke into the synthetic cop’s holofield.
Otto sighed as his image flickered brightly off the smoke. “We know who, where, when.”
I closed my eyes and smirked. “But you got fuck-all to send after ‘em so you gotta hire on freelancers?”
“Jackass. No. To tell you the truth, Tom old boy-”
By which I knew there was no way in hell he was being honest.
“-we don’t know WHAT they took. Here.” He waved and part of his holographic representation resolved into security camera footage. “Greeney’s lockup services, north branch. Camera’s got ‘em goin’ in, empty-handed, goin’ out, pockets full, no blip on the radar. Lucky break, they hit an autobank terminal later that night.” The video flickered and shifted. The same four men from the previous clip were expressionessly tearing  into a computer terminal with some kind of energy saws.
I almost squinted at the clip, but didn’t. I didn’t want to betray a flicker of emotion, because I noticed something that gave me a hell of a lot more than a flicker. The second video clip wasn’t the same as the first- not just different lighting or a different camera, but something was off about the colors. Faint blue afterimages seemed to trail a few pixels behind the men in the video- and that meant…
I nodded slowly. “These guys ain’t pros.”
Otto spread his hands. “Exactly.”
“But someone helpin’ ‘em is.”
The see-through cop nodded vigorously and the video he’d shown me winked away.
Weird camera angle for a computer terminal, expressionless faces, and staticky blue auras around the people in the second video…
The second clip had been computer-edited.
I grinned. “I’m in. Let’s talk compensation.”
He rubbed his hands together. “Fantastic! All right, how’s-” He named a pathetic figure.
He’s gauging me, tryin’ to see if I’ve caught on. Tryin’ to see how eager I am. “You crazy? You want me to risk my sorry ass for drinkin’ money? I could spend thirty seconds on my handheld and prove someone’s wife is cheating and make twice that.”
The old holographic fraud’s smile didn’t get any smaller. Either he was satisfied that the con was good, or-
“How much would you do it for?”
I named a figure quadruple his original offer.
A few minutes of haggling wrestled the compensatory figure to something more appropriate– though I knew full well there was no chance that I’d collect…
When I grabbed my hat and left, I started whistling. There’s seldom better money easier got than in conning a con, if you’re good at that kind of thing. You get one guess who’s the world-champion best at that kind of thing. I mean, you should know by now.

Edge of town. No money. No clue.
Phone. Buzzing. Collar ID- “Thomas.”
“Hello?”
“Lay low. Gonna text you an address- hotel owner owes me a favor. I’ll email you.”
“”What the fuck is happening? I don’t–”
“Can’t talk now.”
“Is Greg-”
But he’d already hung up.
bleakly

Walkin’ along, whistlin’ a song, tappin’ absent-mindedly at my handheld. It started raining. A car with a headlight out almost splashed me.
Otto was a relic. An agent of the system. A holographic meter maid given more and more responsibility as centralized organization broke down and the corporations took over more and more of the business of governing.
He had his own motives, these days. And he was trying to set me up, use me somehow. And that was absolutely fine with me: if he could really pull one over on me, he’d deserve it.
Now, I’m not being totally fair. I was going to trounce his see-through ass and I knew it. But by allowing for the possibility of his triumph, I felt a little less like I was about to punch a baby in the face after taking its candy.
Otto’d given me five leads. I knew at least three of them were designed to throw me off the scent of what was really going on: like Otto said, these guys were amateurs, and Otto had the resources of the city’s surveillance grid. Now hey, that grid might have been a little rusty, but for a computer program, Otto was doin’ alright.
So anyway, right away I’d picked out the only place these kids could realistically be hiding out. Two of ‘em were on Judas’ turf, and one of them was in a part of town where any clowns as amateur as these kids would be gutted in a second. That left two. One of them was perfect, a run-down mill in a quiet part of town, the kind of place Otto could arrange the players in this thing like pawns and then clean up.
The other one was near my favorite bar. I’d go in, throw some dudes around, flaunt my temporary Agent-Of-The-System status to get a few free drinks, then go clean up Otto’s con before dinnertime.
It rained harder. I whistled louder.

The hotel had internet, tv. Clean sheets. The little things that make a hotel a more reasonable place to stay than a plain pine box. The owner– an old German guy– told me I could stay as long as I needed. Why does Bleakly know so many old people?
Phone buzzed.
“Hello?”
“Can’t explain right now. Greg’s fine. Lay low, stay low. We’ll come for you when it’s time.”
I spluttered. “When it’s time for what? What the fuck, Bleakly? For the love of-”
“Shut up. What’s your dad’s blood type?”
“What?”
“I asked what your father’s blood type is.”
“I’d think you’d know, you-”
“I do know, actually. I want to know whether YOU know. You’re going to need to know everything about your father. Spend some time remembering. I’ll fax a dossier on him to you tomorrow morning.”
I almost threw my phone. “You want me to study a dossier on my own father, who you say is not dead but also not alive, and you’ve done what exactly with the information you got from breaking and entering into Nocter Pharmaceuticals, you’ve got fuckinggoons following us everywhere, what the hell do you want?”
There were faint voices and laughter audible in the background. “Sorry, what? I was paying for my drink- wait, yeah. Just, don’t go anywhere. Read the dossier. We’ll contact you.”
“You-” and he hung up on me again.
I called back five times. The fifth time I left a voicemail that included as many curse words as I could remember.
bleakly

I had four or five drinks in me and had laid out about the same number of random thugs to hilariously little effect. I’d made a big enough show of promoting my unique brand of sleuthery at that point, so I figured it was time to call Otto’s bluff and see what the hell he was after.
So. Let’s recap.
Otto had shown me two pieces of footage. In one of ‘em, some dumb-lookin’ dudes stole something officially nonexistent (read: insanely valuable) from an ultra-high-profile security outfit without setting off a single alarm.
In another scene, they’re busting an ATM. Only thing is, in that scene, they’ve got a faint, fuzzy, blue digital aura: the hallmark of faked footage.
It was a lucky thing for me that as an adolescent I used to constantly search for nude holography of famous actresses, or else I’d never be an expert at telling real footage from the computer-edited kind.
Back to the stooges. Clearly they’ve got some assistance pulling off a big heist. Otto’s showing me altered video. It didn’t take a genius to put together what was actually going on… or at least the outlines.
I stepped off the conveyor sidewalk and strolled around to the side entrance of the warehouse my handheld had directed me to. I mean, come on. The front door was gonna be locked, bugged, guarded anyway.
I kicked in the rustiest door in sight– which was, coincidentally, the only side door– and found myself immersed in an almost-palpable darkness. I felt through my coat pockets for my flashlight. I DID have a flashlight, right? Wait, don’t I have one integrated on my handhel–
Suddenly, all my senses prickled and a tingle went through my body. I wasn’t alone.
To be perfectly fair in my description of my own sleuth-senses and what-not, I should probably include the following details: the tingling I was experiencing was accompanied by a cameo appearance of my buddies Steve and Hector, as well as a sharp blow to the back of my head.
In response, I hissed, “FUCK!!!” 
I heard a noncommittal sound behind me and decided to allow my reflexes to sort things out while I sulked over how many braincells I’d lost in the last few weeks and the ratio of said braincells I’d lost in the course of painful rather than pleasurable activities.
A few moments later, I took the controls back from my reflexes. My reflexes had found the flashlight attachment on my handheld (Jeez, guys, couldn’t you have just told me where the damn thing was?) and placed the barrel of my sixty-shooter between the teeth of a terrified-looking teenager at whose feet was a short length of aluminum pipe.
Oh, I thought. New guy. 
I rubbed my face with the hand that wasn’t busy tickling the kid’s tonsils.
“Okay, look, kid. Here’s- you gotta know some things.” I clipped the handheld to my coat’s collar so that its beam was still aimed in the general vicinity of the kid’s face.
He was shaking and wide-eyed. Pupils were a little differently focused- he might’ve been into some riprun or other such crap. His hands were slightly above his head, but it didn’t look like he had full control of his fingers.
“All right, look.” Using my free hand, I started going through the kid’s pockets. “Life ain’t like the holoshows. You punch someone real good in the face, maybe you slug ‘em in the back of the head with a bit of pipe, maybe they’ll be in enough pain they go down right then.” Wallet was mostly empty, but what was there would get me a couple beers. “But if they’re a hardcore motherfucker, they won’t. So,  you want to use something likethis–” I pulled the small laser pistol from the back of his waistband– “first so that you don’t wind up in an uncomfortable situation like this.” I looked at the kid’s heater. It was not what I was expecting- it was a surgical-grade laser overclocked to accept a weapons-grade power cell, all in a custom housing. Nice bit of work and entirely untraceable. “Thing’d probably put a neat hole the size of a nickel in somebody. Hm.” 
I test-fired it through the kid’s left kneecap. It did indeed leave a neat hole the size of a nickel, and it didn’t leave him bleeding, either. I could probably sell the thing and get enough booze to last me a couple days.
I made it a personal policy of mine not to kill the younger and dumber people who enter the dark world I inhabit. The reasoning is that the lower I allow the general level of competence to drop, the better I’ll seem. Also, it helps to build the brand if you leave ‘em broken and weeping for mercy. If you leave no survivors, nobody gets to tell of you in hushed whispers.
Especially with my brand-new headache, I’d have much preferred a hushed whisper to the screams the kid had decided to go with at that moment, but what can you do.

I disembarked the bus outside the theatre and crossed the street. A vehicle with a single working headlight barreled past mere inches from me and sped off into the night; my heart’s rhythm duly noted the event as dangerous, but it seemed an isolated event. 
The theatre was much as I’d remembered it. The paint that had been brilliant gold was peeling in places and painted over in others, the dapper lad in the box office had been replaced with a bored teenage girl, and the carpet had been replaced with a putrid green thing of some sort– but somehow it still sparkled, as if its old glory could actually shine through the muck of this modern era.
I bought my ticket and settled in for the show. This was more difficult than one might think at first- I was wearing a far thicker coat than the weather demanded, and it was filled with a few simple tools to assist me in gaining a measure of invisibility for my next movements.
I could feel no eyes burning in the back of my head. I felt no shiver of apprehension. But still I knew that any member of the audience could well be one of City’s men, sent to prevent my progress or silence me if I came too close to some ugly truth.
The play was Hamlet; the actors were very talented, for these modern times. I regretted that I would need to miss the denoument. 
I quietly excused myself to the Gentlemen’s room. This was a sad, small affair that had sustained far too much abuse for a modest theatre’s facilities. Still, it was a quiet spot, and if I still possessed the required faculties–
In one motion, I shed the coat, brushed on contact lenses and a fake moustache, and turned my vest inside-out. I pushed my wadded coat through the small window slot and into the outside alley.
Four minutes later I left through a forgotten back exit and reclaimed my coat. Five minutes later I boarded a bus bound for downtown.
It wasn’t a very flashy or daring maneuver, but it meant that  if I was cautious, I could begin searching in earnest… and, with luck, I’d make Cornelius City pay.
It was the only honorable option.
Bleakly

The kid was taken care of, at least as far as I cared to take care of him. I’m just a caring guy.
I unclipped my handheld from my collar and explored a little deeper into the warehouse.
The place was clean for an abandoned warehouse in that part of town. Floors looked to be swept pretty regularly; there weren’t any crates or barrels lying around. That was weird. I let my guard come all the way up and started looking for something to explain what the inexperienced saps Otto’d suckered were up to.
A few rooms in, the demeanor of the place changed entirely– carpeted floors, functional-looking lights. I found a wall-mounted control pad and toggled a few switches. Lights dutifully came on in the room I was in– revealing what appeared to be a decently-furnished breakroom with a window on the far wall. I toggled another switch and light blazed through the window; I immediately registered movement on the other side of the window and threw myself behind an office chair.
 I lay there a couple minutes, trying to figure out what the commotion on the other side of the window meant.
All right Tommy boy. This is a warehouse. There’s most likely a big ol’ factory type room thing on the other side of that window. Whatever is moving around is either unable to come get you, unwilling to investigate, or simply doesn’t care.
Plus, caution isn’t my thing.
I stood up and walked over to the window. It was one-way glass, so maybe that explained why whatever was on the other–
What. The. Hell.
The atrium-sized room opposite the window was full. Full of zebras.

bleakly

All right, zebras. Zebras zebras zebras.
Whatever the hell THAT meant. Had I been some sort of paranoid man, I would assume that the little square of glass was lying to me. But if there’s one thing I always do, it’s trust the images I see through windows.
No, wait. The one thing I always do is drink. That’s what I always do.
I pressed my fingertips against the glass. It didn’t look like a holographic display, but I couldn’t take any chances. I fired a few rounds through it.
The glass gave way revealing that it was just a simple window. Excellent, I’m good with windows.
The room I entered through the window was still full of zebras; the zebras were all panicky and would probably have liked to stampede at that point, but they were restricted by the fact that the room was only about the size of a basketball court. They settled for being a striped, turmoiling sea.
I surveyed my surroundings. There appeared to be a lot of abandoned factory-type equipment where there weren’t zebras. Maybe it was a Juicy Fruit factory…
There was a network of catwalks about a story up. There was a ladder leading to the catwalks in one corner of the room, so I decided to reduce my chances of getting trampled by accomplishing some vertical movement. Luckily, the spooked animals were still pretty afraid of me, so they stayed out of my way long enough for me to swing up onto the ladder.
I reached the top of the ladder and came face to face with a man wearing a labcoat and dark goggles. He was a short little bastard with a really pained facial expression. I was considering how best to give him a reason for the expression when he addressed me.
“Mister Bleakly, do you always have to break that window every time you come here?”
jacobson

I was finally prepared to initiate my incursion on the City estate. I had all the essential gadgetry, I’d reviewed the limited blueprints available to me, I’d cursed Thomas’ name thoroughly, and I’d shaken anyone who might be following me.
I was about a mile out from City’s estate, which I estimated put me a few dozen meters outside the bounds of his security net. I rubbed my hands and thrust them into my pockets for a moment to warm them and collect my thoughts. In my right pocket, my fingers closed around the Omnigun, which was still in the shape of a harmless fountain pen. In my left, my fingers touched the cold metal of the two clips of ammunition I’d considered necessary. It was not the sort of precaution I ever enjoyed taking… but in this case my objective was to recover young Miss Smith. They’d taken her by violence, and I’d take her back in like manner if necessary.
I slung my satchel of supplies over one shoulder and began walking down the sparsely lit street in the direction of City Hall. If only I had Thomas with–
I noticed the glare of a single headlight approaching behind me. That’s odd, that’s the fourth or fifth– Cold understanding gripped me. I pulled the pen from my right pocket and the clip of ammunition from my left. My stride lengthened, and I gritted my teeth. The countermeasures in my satchel should have at least allowed me to penetrate the first layer of City’s security!
The beat-up sedan with tinted windows and a single headlight slowed and pulled alongside the sidewalk. I must admit my old heart protested this series of events.
I stopped and turned to the vehicle, my fingers twitching on the dormant shape of the Omnigun.
The sedan’s electric window dropped away with a far-too-loud grinding sound. The face it revealed took me a moment to recognize, not because it was an unrecognizable face, but rather through sheer denial.
Cornelius City leaned out the passenger window. His eyes glowed a dull red, and his smile would have sent a lesser man to his grave. He spoke quietly, but the night itself seemed to hold its breath to catch his words. “My dear Gregory, not all security precautions are technological in nature. Not all of them, in fact, are entirely natural. Please, join me.” With that, the rear passenger door of the car swung open of its own volition.
I’m an old man. I’ve felt my body protest before. I’ve felt joints and muscles buck and disobey… but never in concert. My every muscle went as tense as an overtightened violin string, and, obeying a will other than my own, propelled me into the waiting darkness of City’s vehicle.
The chubby guy occupying the labcoat continued to look at me impassively. I sighed and put the barrel of my sixty-shooter to his forehead. The impassive expression continued unchanged.
I smirked. “We both know if I pull this trigger it will be both a felony, and utterly useless. Good job getting into my head there, though. I don’t wanna know how you found out about the doppelganger, and I applaud your creativity, but stop it. Jig’s up, Otto.”
The labcoat melted and gave way to a police uniform. The bastardliness remained. He grinned in that infuriatingly inhuman way that holograms do. “There’s still a few of ‘em in here, Bleak. You gotta track ‘em down and figure out the hell they’re doing with all these zebras.”
I shook my head. “Nope. I know exactly what you conned these guys into, and what the zebras are for. ‘Cause the only thing useful to you is information. And the only good way to hide information these days is to not keep it all in one place.” I waved down at the confused herd of zebras. “You broke the payload up into a few hundred compressed chunks and had your patsies hide it right in the DNA of the poor animals down there. Too bad I was two steps ahead of you.”
He continued to grin, but his physical representation flickered as he drew on more processing bandwidth to figure out how I knew what I knew. Even holograms got tells.
I holstered the gun, unholstered my handheld, and blazed my patented even-more-annoying-than-a-hologram grin at him at a hundred percent intensity. “Best thing is, you think you have the entire thing genetically encoded and spread throughout the herd. But I managed to grab a couple of the most important terabytes. If you want what I got, you’re gonna have to bargain for it.”
My handheld’s screen blinked red, and I gave its surface a nonchalant tap.Cookiejar_noose.1_z closed with a satisfied beep. I was suddenly really glad that I’d taken the time to prepare for this very contingency– an AI trying to hack me.
Otto’s synthetic facial expression went from impassive to puzzled to really, really mad. “You–”
“Yep!” I kissed the screen of my trusty digital assistant. “I didn’t have shit, obviously. How the hell could I? You had this con airtight. Didn’t stop you from jamming your digital arm all the way into the boobytrapped digital cookie jar. The thing about the zebras was a guess, by the way. Thanks for confirming it.”
Code spilled across Otto’s face as he struggled for coherency– a valiant attempt, considering at least a third of his processor power was already wrapped up in my handheld and quickly getting dumped to a quarantined server I’d whipped up for just such an occasion.
I sighed again. “Man, what the hell should I do with my very own holocop?”
Otto was stuttering. “This– resis– isting arrest– assaulting an officer–”
“Go to sleep, Otto. Good game. Play again.”
Otto faded out of existence and into my private storage space.
The zebras continued to mill around. The small-time guys Otto had tricked into pulling off the heist would be taken care of easily; the security foundation entrusted with the infobomb Otto stole would probably already be alerted and on their way, since Otto’s attention and the protection that came with it now belonged entirely to me.
I chuckled at the thought of the poor, underpaid technicians who would have to do the zebra blood samples to properly resequence their precious data. Then a thought occurred to me, and I started looking for the controls to open the warehouse’s docking bay doors. After all, if there’s one thing I always said this city needed, it’s a herd of genetically modified zebras running wild in the streets. 
Or, wait. I always say something about letting yellows mellow. That’s what I always say.
